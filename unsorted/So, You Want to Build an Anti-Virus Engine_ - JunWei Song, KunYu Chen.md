1. A malware crime consists of action and target
2. Loss of fame > Loss of wealth (Hard to recover = Felony)
3. Arithmetic sequence
4. The latter the stage, the more we're sure that crime is practiced. (The order Theory)
5. The more evidence we caught, the more weight we give.(The order Theory)
6. Proportional Sequence (The order Theory)
7. Crimes are independent events
8. Threshold generate system
