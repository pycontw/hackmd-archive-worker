## Why would you leave Python?
* "I just got here!"
    * It's great! ...but do take programming vacation.
* Ian Bicking's ["Saying goodbye to Python"](http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/02/saying-goodbye-to-python.html) (Feb. 2014)
    
## Before we leave Python...
* "How did I get here?"
* There's no substitute of experience.
- My idea of fun isn't yours. We are all different.
    * Pioneers, develop without any safety.
    * Farming, the original full-stack development
    * Tourist

## Leaving Python
* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)
    * [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/)
* Greetings from [Golang](https://golang.org/)
    * tooling
        * `GOOS=` and `GOARCH=...`
        * `go fmt;` `go fix;`
    * elegant and robust concurrency model: GoRoutines and channels
    * interfaces provide safer duck-typing
* Experience [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/)
    * clean architecture
        - a model
        - an update function
        - a rendering of a model
    * eliminate runtime errors
    * compile time errors
* Invest in [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/)
    * build airtight programs
    * dependent type
    * autogeneration of code
        - dialog with the compiler & runtime
