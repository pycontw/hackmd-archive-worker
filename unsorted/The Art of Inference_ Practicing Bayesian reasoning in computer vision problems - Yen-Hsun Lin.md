> 從這開始

* Part 1, Theory
  * What is an image exactly?
    - Photon->Down sampling->Process->Record
  * Comparison between recorded scene and natural scene
    * Finite VS. Infinite
  * Pixels are correlated to neighbor pixels!
      * A deteriorated pixel x can be reconstructed according to its neighborhood through Bayes'rule

* Part 2, Hands-on examples
  * Image denoising
      * Iterated conditional Mode
      * Gibbs Sampling
  * Image inpainting
  * Recover blurred image
      * X is the blurred image, Goal is the camera motion.

* Part 3, Convolutional Autoencoder
  * Convolutional AutoEncoders (CAE)
