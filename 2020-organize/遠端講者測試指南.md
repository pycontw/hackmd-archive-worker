#  遠端講者測試指南
## 登記測試時間
遠端講者測試將在**Aug. 22 (Sat.)** 至 **Aug. 28 (Fri.)** 舉行
請到[Google表單](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YOn17vA-oo1GbxJMr4GFWSRNZP-yi_DYMzn0cyFH7VE/edit?usp=sharing)選擇一個您可以參與的測試時間
一位講者的測試時間約為10分鐘。

大會將會提前發信給遠端講者一個當天測試所用的Google Meet連結


## 目標
* 確認講者的設備符合需求 (解析度、連線品質、有耳機...等)
* Discord(https://discord.gg/94hgCQv)完成註冊並已加入身分組 (`2020-speaker`與`2020-remote`)
* 走過一遍[測試流程](#測試流程)
* 感謝講者參與測試，並提醒當天相關事項 (如果有)

## 測試流程
### 1. 設定Google Meet並加入會議
講者與主持人透過預先開好的Google Meet連結加入會議，Google Meet至此將暫時作為本次測試的溝通工具。

### 2. 說明今天講者測試的流程
主持人向講者們簡單說明今天測試的流程。大致如下：
* 確認講者的環境設定 (大家一起進行)
* 協助設定Discord (大家一起進行)
* 請講者們決定稍後試走演講流程的順序誰先誰後
* 試走一遍演講流程 (一個一個進行)
* 試走完演講流程後的講者就可以先行離開

### 3. 確認講者的環境設定
主持人先行確認講者的環境符合要求。跟講者確認此次的環境是否即為屆時使用的環境，如果不是的話需再跟講者提醒大會的環境需求。
* 請講者打開攝影機，讓webcam畫面可以被看到
    * 確認講者的webcam的影像是否清晰，臉部光線是否充足
    * 確認講者有耳機，而不是使用喇叭 (**必要!**)
    * 確認講者有麥克風，且聲音清晰
* 請講者分享螢幕畫面
    * 確認講者的連線品質是否穩定，如果不穩定可以提醒講者能否改善網路
    * 確認講者的螢幕解析度是++1920x1080(1080p)++ (講者的分享畫面在Meet中要是滿版)
* 請講者打開當天的簡報 (不用是完成版)
    * 確認講者的簡報比例符合++16:9++
    * 請講者翻翻簡報，確認講者簡報動畫或過場沒有嚴重延遲問題

以上狀況若有問題，請試著當下提供辦法解決。若無法立即解決，詢問講者是否能最後再試走演講流程，讓其他講者可以先走演講流程並先行離開。

**已知可能問題與解法(持續更新)**
* 有延遲問題：瀏覽器若不是使用 Chrome，可以嘗試使用 Chrome 看能否解決


### 4. 協助設定Discord
* 若講者尚未安裝Discord與註冊帳號，請先協助講者按照[設定 Discord](/ePR6dwKnSaGKK_q86bondQ#設定-Discord)完成的Discord設定流程
* 確認講者有加入兩個身分組：`2020-speaker`與`2020-remote`

### 5. 試走一遍演講流程
#### 前置準備
* 講者與助理主持人先加入Discord的 🔊remote-guide 頻道，並確認大家麥克風都靜音。(可以提醒講者這是一個單向頻道，基本上只是讓助理主持人對講者做時間提醒而已)

#### 介紹 (15 seconds)
* 主持人簡短介紹講者與演講題目，並cue講者開始演講
* 主持人關掉Google Meet麥克風與webcam畫面
#### 講者試講 (30 seconds)
* 助理主持人在講者試講時，嘗試做剩餘時間提醒。 (步驟：講者講了大概10秒後，助理主持人打開Discord麥克風，並做出"剩下一分鐘"的時間提醒，提醒完後就關掉Discord麥克風)
#### 結束
* 主持人打開Google Meet麥克風並中斷講者的試講
* 所有人可以退出 🔊remote-guide 頻道
* 提醒講者當天議程結束後，請記得自行退出Meet會議
* 感謝這位講者今天參與，並提醒他可以先行離開了

# Remote Session Rehearsal Guideline
## Register your rehearsal time slot
Speaker rehearsals will be held from **Aug. 22 (Sat.)** to **Aug. 28 (Fri.)**. 
Please refer to the [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YOn17vA-oo1GbxJMr4GFWSRNZP-yi_DYMzn0cyFH7VE/edit?usp=sharing) to select an available time slot for you.

The rehearsal time for one speaker is about 10 minutes.

PyCon TW will send every remote speaker an email with Google Meet invite link for rehearsal beforehand.


## Purpose
* Make sure speakers' devices satisfy our requirements. (Resolution, connection quality, headset etc.)
* Has registered to Discord(https://discord.gg/94hgCQv), and already joins the roles (`2020-speaker` and `2020-remote`)
* Go through [Rehearsal flow](#Rehearsal-flow)
* Thank speakers for joining the rehearsal, and remind them something important on that day (if any).

## Rehearsal flow
### 1. Setup Google Meet and join the meeting
Speakers and session chairs join the Google Meet that already known beforehand. For now, Google Meet will temporarily act as the communication tool for the rehearsal.
### 2. Brief introduction of rehearsal flow
Session chairs introduce rehearsal flow to speakers, which shown as below:
* Check speakers' environments settings (Can be done simultaneously)
* Help setting up Discord (Can be done simultaneously)
* Ask speakers to decide their turn to go through presentation flow.
* Go through the presentation flow (One by one)
* Speakers can leave after finishing presentation flow if they want

### 3. Check speakers' environments settings
Session chairs should check speakers' environments match the requirements. Furthermore, check if the current settings are exactly the same as the settings used on conference day. If it is not, remind speakers the requirements that PyCon TW needed.
* Speakers open their webcam, so that they can be seen on session chair's screen.
    * Check if speakers' webcam video is clear, the illumination on face is ok.
    * Check that speakers have a headset with them, and not using a speakers. (**Required!**)
    * Check speakers have a microphone and the voice is clear.
* Speakers start screen sharing
    * Check speakers' connection quality is stable, if it is not, suggest speakers if they can improve it.
    * Check speakers' screen resolution is ++1920x1080(1080p)++ (So that speakers shared screen should be full-size in Google Meet without border)
* Speakers open their presentation materials (No need to be complete version)
    * Check speakers' presentation materials aspect ratio is ++16:9++
    * Speakers try go through some pages to make sure there is no severe delay problem.

If there is any problem during the above testing, try to solve it right away. If you can't, ask speakers if they can be the last one go through the presentation flow, so that other speakers can go through it and leave first.

**Already known problems and possible solution**
* Screen delay or jigger: If speakers' browser is not Chrome, try using Chrome and see if it works better.

### 4. Help setting up Discord
* If speakers have not installed Discord and register an account, help speakers complete setting procedure according to [Setting up Discord](/ePR6dwKnSaGKK_q86bondQ#Setting-up-Discord)
* Make sure speakers have joined two roles in Discord: `2020-speaker` and `2020-remote`

### 5. Go through the presentation flow.
#### Preparation
* Speakers and session chairs join channel 🔊remote-guide on Discord, and make sure everyone is muted in channel. (Remind speakers that this channel is a single-way channel that only used for assistant chairs to make remaining time reminder to speakers)
#### Introduction (15 seconds)
* Session chairs make brief introduction, and give speakers a cue to start their presentation.
* Session chairs mute themselves and switch off webcam on Google Meet
#### Presentation (30 seconds)
* During the presentation, assistant chair tries to do remaining time remind (Step: After speakers speak 10 seconds, assistant chair unmutes on Discord, reminds speakers the remaining time with sentence like "one minute left" , then mutes again on Discord.)
#### End
* Session chairs switch on their microphone on Google Meet and interrupt Speakers.
* All members may leave channel 🔊remote-guide on Discord.
* Remind speakers remember to leave Google Meet by themselves when session ends during the conference day.
* Give thanks to this speaker join today's rehearsal, and remind him/her can leave now if he/she wants.
