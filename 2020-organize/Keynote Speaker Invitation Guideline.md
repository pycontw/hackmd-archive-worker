## Keynote Candidate Invitation Table
The keynote speaker 2020 candidates are listed at [Keynote Candidate](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lj1uYu3zXlx2Y_ZXD-cAUUeZPlTtYXJ-s9xDJ5ucdCQ/edit#gid=0).

## Invitation Flow
* 邀請 3 個 keynote speakers (2020)
    * 三個不同領域的講者分別屬於:
        * Core
        * Science
        * 國內講者
    * 在每一個分類中的講者都應該一個一個照順序邀請
        * e.g., Core 中的第一位邀請如果被拒絕則應該邀請 Core 中的第二位，Science 的第一位如果被拒絕則應該開始邀請第二位
* A full invitation cycle has status: 
    * “**STARTED**” -> “**ACCEPTED**” or “**REJECTED**” or “**DECIDING**”
* When the invitee replies with firm yes or no, update the status to ACCEPTED or REJECTED. If needed, add the related information at the invitation log column (e.g. reply date). In some cases, invitee may have some questions and it is not apparent to know whether he/she will come or not, set the status to **DECIDING**.

## Invitation Rules
* Add program chair into cc list
    * program@pycon.tw
* First Invitation should include
    * 時間
    * 地點
    * 場地 （如果能的話，提供照片和設備）
    * PyCon TW 介紹
    * 受眾輪廓
    * 講師費
* Budget
    * 交通費實報實銷，但需要請講者提供大概的數字讓我們確認是否有超出預算
    * 講師費為 20,000 新台幣
* **We don’t limit the talk topic. But if the invitee asks or gives options, I’ll let all program members know and decide**.
* (2017) 特別備註，如果講者願意帶來 tutorial 或是 workshop 會提供更多補助給講者。（例如：講者 team  的機票補助等）

## Follow-up Letters

    * Profile picture
    * Short biography
    * Talk Title
    * Abstract
    * Estimation of travel expense
* We can help reserve accommodation at the venue.
* Pickup service is available between Taoyuan airport and the venue (flight info required)

## 邀請信確認事項 (2017)
* 把 細節 1 到 5 弄成英文範本文件，日後邀請人附連結，或想要複製貼上，就變得容易。
    1. 飛機抵達與接機
        * 班機抵達時間能不能追蹤（萬一誤點或是停飛等等能不能事先知道）
            * Andrew 和 Russell 還沒給班機時間，預計 5/8 要寄信詢問。
            * 如何透過網路聯繫抵達台灣講者？whoscall？
            * 以 Carol 的班機資訊為例，因為她已經主動提供詳細時間了，我們可以技巧用「If you need pick-up service, the cab driver should meet you around OO:XX am, your arrival time」來再次確認。
        * 講者有接機
            * 詢問 Rock 訂車合作廠商
            * 廠商據說可以透過 line 聯繫
            * 講者聯繫
        3. 萬一沒有接送成功的配套方案（小黃？要發票報帳）
    2. 房店訂房
        * 目前預定中研院，會事先通知，抵達時可以直接入住。
        * 但目前據說中研院滿房，要確認外面訂房狀況 (⅝ 那週確認房間)。
    3. 接機到台北
        * 送到中研院內飯店
    4. 報帳需要文件
        1. 護照影本
        2. 領據（講師費或日支才需要）
        3. 機票收據（電子機票或代收轉付收據）
        4. 登機證 (Boarding Pass) 正本，回程登機證可用電子檔案或影本。
        5. 如果不是合約租車需要單據
    5. Keynote 當天需要設備準備(其實與一般講者同)。可以參考過去資訊[信件](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=zh-TW#!searchin/pycontw/liang%7Csort:relevance/pycontw/Kcu2Hg0bOXc/unD6FnBAEgAJ)1，[信件](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=zh-TW#!searchin/pycontw/liang%7Csort:relevance/pycontw/5cx0uBswg8c/Kq0q2AxIEgAJ)2
        1. 麥克風或是耳掛麥克風
        2. 轉接頭(不能用 vga 只能用 hdmi)
        3. 投影片是否需要先提供測試)
        4. 事先詢問講者電腦型號，準備備用電腦，萬一講者電腦沒辦法輸出（轉 pdf）

Kindly remind that your keynote session would be scheduled at 6/10 09:20~10:20 in the morning(60 minutes, Q&A included).

To make your visit comfortable, we would pick you up at the airport when you arrive, accompany you to the hotel and assist you with the check-in procedure. Therefore, I would appreciate if you could let us know your flight information (or traveling plan) and the arrival time at Taoyuan airport. If you decide to take our pick-up service, the cost is around NTD 1,400 (US$40 per trip, taxi fares will be prepaid). The expense will be deducted from the reimbursement. In case you prefer to take Taoyuan International Airport MRT and then transfer to Taipei MRT to the hotel, you can refer to the information below [1]. (Information of the accommodation will be sent to you later)

Here, we have several updates to share with you:

* Regarding reimbursement, you will need to provide the following documents:
1. Copy of passport
2. Original invoice/receipt of flight ticket - can be electronic ticket
3. Original Boarding Pass - for return ticket, electronic version or copy is acceptable
4. Payment receipt for taxi in case you didn’t use our airport pickup service
* Regarding keynote speech equipment :
1. Projector only accepts HDMI port connection. If your computer only supports VGA port, please let us know in advance.
2. We can test the presentation slides for you beforehand.
3. Please let us know your preference in using microphone or headset one.
4. We would like to know the specification of model of your computer to prepare another one for backup solution in case there are problems when exporting the file.

Please let me know if there’s anything I can help.

Sincerely,

Alice Tuan
