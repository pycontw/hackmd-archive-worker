## 20200320 通知已投稿者新增「遠端分享」選項
Title: [PyConTW2020] Remote Policy 遠端視訊演講

(Mandarin Version Below 中文版在下方)

Dear Author,

I'm **[name]**, PyCon Taiwan 2020 Program Committee. First of all, thank you again for participating in PyCon Taiwan 2020.

As you probably already know, many conferences are being canceled, postponed, or going virtual left and right due to the health concern caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19).

Therefore, we would like to inform you that PyCon Taiwan's plans for the current situation. Although we were still hopeful that the situation would improve in time for the event in August, we cannot guarantee that the epidemic (coronavirus) will be controlled before the event. All things considered, the PyCon Taiwan team discussed various situations and alternatives, so there was a remote policy.

To this end, we would like to collect some feedback. We have provided you with an option in the Call For Paper system, "Whether you agree to deliver the talk remotely if the epidemic (coronavirus) is still raging this August?", let us know what you think of this kind of remote policy.

If you have other considerations or questions, please feel free to contact us.


各位投稿者您好：

我是 PyCon Taiwan 議程組的 **[name]**，首先再次感謝各位參與本次的議程投稿。

如同大家所知，由於新型冠狀病毒 (COVID-19) 所引發的問題，許多會議被取消，延期或虛擬化。因此，我們希望告知您 PyCon Taiwan 針對目前狀況的計畫，儘管我們希望情況會有所好轉，但我們無法保證在八月活動前，疫情能夠獲得控制。有鑑於此，PyCon Taiwan 團隊討論了各種情況和替代方案，於是有了遠端分享的方案。

為此，我們想收集一些反饋，我們在投稿系統中為您提供了一個選項「因應新型冠狀病毒疫情，若到八月疫情未趨緩，是否同意以遠端方式進行演講？」，使 PyCon Taiwan 2020 得以遠端分享的方式進行，請讓我們知道您對這種遠端分享的想法。

如果您有其他考量或是疑問，歡迎隨時與我們聯絡。


Best regards,
**[name]**

Note that the timezone used here is Taiwan Time (GMT+8).

We'll begin our review shortly. After the first review stage, we’ll start our modification stage from May 18 to May 31.

I'm **{inviter}** from PyCon Taiwan 2020 program committee. First of all, thank you for submitting your talk for PyCon Taiwan 2020. We appreciate your taking your time to share your ideas with us and value your patience.

Ｗe regret to inform you that your proposal "{proposal_title}" has not been selected by our program committee because of the high competitiveness of this year. 

We’re really sorry that we can't have your presentation on PyCon TW 2020. However,  we strongly encourage you to submit your proposals to the local community. Having talks in a local community allows speakers to test their ideas prior to the conference, get feedback, and have direct interactions with the audiences.

親愛的 {name} 您好，

我是 PyCon Taiwan 2020 議程組的**{inviter}**(**{inviter}**)，首先，再次感謝您對 PyCon Taiwan 2020的投稿。感謝您抽出寶貴時間與我們分享您的想法，並感謝您耐心等待。

由於今年參與審查的投稿競爭相對激烈，在第一階段評選結果後您的投稿分數以些微差距未獲錄取。

我們相當遺憾不能在 PyCon TW 2020 聽到您的演講。我們誠摯邀請您能轉投稿地方社群，地方社群的形式比較不像一般演講正式，講者可以隨興發揮並與現場參與會眾進行互動。我們非常鼓勵您向地方社群投稿您的提案。

### 錄取

Title: [PyCon TW 2020] Proposal Decision -- {proposal_title}

Dear {name},

(Mandarin Version Below 中文版在下方)

Congratulations!

Your proposal submission "{proposal_title}" has been Accepted for inclusion into the conference program by the program committee of PyCon Taiwan 2020!

Please let us know whether you are able to attend as soon as you can. If we have not heard from you by June 28, we will begin inviting people from the waitlist.

Please let us know if you accept our talk invitation and what form will you choose to present your talk (participate in-person / participate remotely). If you’re to present remotely, please also let us know your timezone.
(If you are the speaker of the first stage confirmation, you do not need to reply to us this part.)

Note that Taiwan has 14 days of entry isolation at this moment. If you are abroad, we encourage you to arrange in advance or participate remotely. In view of the current control of the epidemic situation in Taiwan, we look forward to holding the physical conference. As long as the government’s policy allows in September, we will stick to the plan. (You can still choose to present your talk remotely.)

After we've confirmed the list of speakers, the registration team will send you an invitation code that allows you to buy a speaker ticket (Everybody Contributes is one of PyCon core principles. All attendees, including speakers and volunteers, have to pay for registering).

Due to the epidemic, some of you might not be able to participate in person. Thus, as compensation for remote speakers who will lose the chance to interact with other attendees in person, you'll get a 100% discount ticket.

PyCon Taiwan has announced its Financial Aid Program this year, which is for anyone who needs financial support to join PyCon TW 2020. You can find more details from the Financial Aid Program.

Besides, PyData Taiwan will be held at the end of November this year. If you’re interested in receiving their information, please fill out the PyData questionnaire.

Please promote!
PyCon TW’s social media team is happy to promote your talk. But the greatest advocates for your talks are you. So, let folks know how excited you are to present at this year’s PyCon Taiwan 2020.

(如果您是第一階段確認的講者，就不需要回覆我們這個部分)

請留意台灣目前有14天的入境隔離期。 如果您在國外，我們建議您提前安排或遠端參加。有鑑於目前台灣對疫情的良好控制，我們計畫舉辦實體會議。只要政府的政策在九月時允許，就依然會維持實體會議(但同時我們也接受線上演講)。

在確定完整講者名單後，註冊組將會寄給您邀請碼，讓您可以購買講者門票(Everybody Contributes 是 PyCon 的核心價值，亦即除特邀來賓外，所有的會議參與者，包括講者與志工，皆需自己付費，方能參加會議)。

由於這次的疫情影響，有些講者可能無法親自參加。因此，作為無法親自與其他與會者互動的遠端講者的補償，您將獲得 100％ 的折扣票。

如果您需要任何的財務上的協助，也誠摯歡迎您申請今年財務補助方案。只要您提出需求，PyCon TW 都會盡可能協助您。如有需要，請到財務補助頁面見詳細申請辦法。

此外，在今年 11 月底將會舉辦 PyData Taiwan ，想詢問您是否有興趣接收相關資訊或將您的稿件轉介至 PyData Taiwan 審核。若您有意願，也煩請您協助我們填寫 PyData 問卷，我們會再進一步通知您。

I'm **{inviter}** from PyCon Taiwan 2020 program committee, thank you for submitting your talk for PyCon Taiwan 2020. We appreciate your taking your time to share your ideas with us and value your patience.

We received many excellent proposals this year, including yours, and the decision-making process was not easy. Many of the submitted proposals were of a good standard, and if time, money and space were no object, we would happily accept them all.

Hence we have added your talk to our waitlist.

It means that there is still a chance for you to speak at PyCon TW. Should another speaker not be able to attend, we will move speakers up from the waitlist to fill their slot. In any case, we are immensely grateful that you took the time and effort to submit a proposal.

Therefore, we sincerely hope that you can give us more opportunities. The conference is expected to make the final decision before 6/28. If you are willing to wait, you can review the comments by the second stage reviewers on the submission system. You can make some adjustments to your proposal based on these comments. However, if you have other plans, please reply to us and the program committee will transfer the priority opportunities to other authors.

Besides, PyData Taiwan will be held at the end of November this year. If you’re interested in receiving their information, please fill out the PyData questionnaire.

今年，我們收到了許多優秀的投稿，其中包括您的稿件，而這決策的過程並不容易，許多的投稿質量都相當高。如果時間，金錢和空間都不是問題的話，我們很樂意接受所有稿件。

因此我們將您的稿件加入至我們的候補名單中。

這意味著您仍有機會在 PyCon TW 上發表演講。如果某位講者無法出席，我們將會從候補名單上遞補講者。無論如何，我們非常感謝您花費時間和精力來投稿今年的 PyCon TW。

因此我們很誠摯的希望各位投稿者能再給我們一些機會，大會預計會在 6/28 號前通知最後錄取的投稿。如果您願意等待，投稿系統上已經可以瀏覽第二階段審查委員意見，您可以根據這些意見再對投稿做些調整。但如果您另有計畫也歡迎來信告訴我們，議程組就會將優先機會移轉給其他投稿者。

此外，在今年 11 月底將會舉辦 PyData Taiwan ，想詢問您是否有興趣接收相關資訊或將您的稿件轉介至 PyData Taiwan 審核。若您有意願，也煩請您協助我們填寫PyData 問卷，我們會再進一步通知您。

如果您有任何疑問，也歡迎您來信 program@pycon.tw 與我們聯繫。

Best Regards,

### 備取上

Dear **name**,

(Mandarin Version Below 中文版在下方)

Congratulations! We decided to promote you to the Web/Data community track from the waitlist!.

It will be held in the afternoon of Day 2

Your proposal submission **"{proposal_title}"** has been Accepted for inclusion into the conference program by the program committee of PyCon Taiwan 2020!

Please let us know whether you are able to attend as soon as you can. If we have not heard from you by August 10, we will begin inviting people from the waitlist.

Please let us know if you accept our talk invitation and what form will you choose to present your talk (participate in-person / participate remotely). If you’re to present remotely, please also let us know your timezone.
(If you are the speaker of the first stage confirmation, you do not need to reply to us this part.)

Note that Taiwan has 14 days of entry isolation at this moment. If you are abroad, we encourage you to arrange in advance or participate remotely. In view of the current control of the epidemic situation in Taiwan, we look forward to holding the physical conference. As long as the government’s policy allows in September, we will stick to the plan. (You can still choose to present your talk remotely.)

After we've confirmed the list of speakers, the registration team will send you an invitation code that allows you to buy a speaker ticket (Everybody Contributes is one of PyCon core principles. All attendees, including speakers and volunteers, have to pay for registering).

Due to the epidemic, some of you might not be able to participate in person. Thus, as compensation for remote speakers who will lose the chance to interact with other attendees in person, you'll get a 100% discount ticket.

PyCon Taiwan has announced its Financial Aid Program this year, which is for anyone who needs financial support to join PyCon TW 2020. You can find more details from the Financial Aid Program.

Besides, PyData Taiwan will be held at the end of November this year. If you’re interested in receiving their information, please fill out the PyData questionnaire.

Please promote!
PyCon TW’s social media team is happy to promote your talk. But the greatest advocates for your talks are you. So, let folks know how excited you are to present at this year’s PyCon Taiwan 2020.

我們很高興通知您的投稿 **"{proposal_title}"** 經過 PyCon Taiwan 2020 審稿委員們的審查後決議投稿為錄取。

請讓我們知道您是否能夠參加，如果在8月10日前仍未收到您的來信，我們將開始邀請候補名單中的人員。

如果您接受 PyCon TW 的演講邀請，也請讓我們知道，您將選擇哪種形式發表您的演講 (親自參加 / 遠端參加) 如果您要進行遠程演講，也請告知我們您的時區。

(如果您是第一階段確認的講者，就不需要回覆我們這個部分)

請留意台灣目前有14天的入境隔離期。 如果您在國外，我們建議您提前安排或遠端參加。有鑑於目前台灣對疫情的良好控制，我們計畫舉辦實體會議。只要政府的政策在九月時允許，就依然會維持實體會議(但同時我們也接受線上演講)。

## 20200627 Community Track Invitation 社群軌講者邀約

[PyCon TW 2020] Community Track Notification 社群軌講者通知

Dear speaker,

(Mandarin Version Below 中文版在下方)

Thank you for joining PyCon TW and being our most important guest, PyCon TW speaker.

We are happy to inform you that you'll be one of the speakers on the community track, the highlight session of this year's PyCon TW event.

The community track will take place between 13:40 to 16:40 on day 2. Due to the form of this session, the time slot is not fixed. If you have a firm preference on time, please let us know.

The community track is a new event in PyCon TW. We choose the talks with specific topics and package them into the same session. We'll leave the conference rooms and go to characteristic cafes, exhibition spaces, and even monuments so that the attendees and speakers can interact with each other more comfortably and closely.

In short, the "community track" is to build strong connections between attendees, speakers, sponsors, and communities!

各位講者您好，

謝謝您願意參與此次 PyCon TW 2020 的活動，並願意擔任我們最為重要的角色，PyCon TW 講者。

我們很高興地通知您，您已被選為社群軌講者之一，這是今年 PyCon TW 活動的重頭戲。社群軌將在第二天的13:40至16:40之間進行。由於此議程的形式時間較不固定，如果您對時間有特別的偏好，也請您讓我們知道。

社區軌是 PyCon TW 的一項新活動。我們選定數個熱門的主題，並且將同主題的精采演講打包成 N 場連續放送的形式，讓會眾能聽得過癮。我們捨棄了儘管專業但是死板的會議室，在有特色的咖啡廳、展演空間、甚至是古蹟內來舉辦上述各種主題的演講，讓會眾能更加舒適地且近距離地與他人互動。

簡言之，「社群軌」就是希望可以為所有人：會眾、講者、贊助商、社群建立更強的連結！

Best Regards,
**{inviter}**
