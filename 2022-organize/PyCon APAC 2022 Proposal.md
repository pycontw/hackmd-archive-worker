# PyCon APAC 2022 Proposal

## A. Key Highlight

- The conference will be organized as a virtual conference on Gather Town by default.
- The proposal review system will invite more experts across the APAC region to share their expertise with the community in the review process.
- We will support speakers also sharing their knowledge and experience with local communities.

## B. Motivation

The first PyCon Taiwan was founded in 2012. Fortunately, we got the chance to host PyCon APAC in Taiwan in both 2014 and 2015. In the next few years, we focused on the local Taiwanese community and dedicated ourselves to spurring discussion in the community. In 2021, we brought up new ideas and concluded our first decade. Now, we get ourselves well-prepared to host PyCon APAC and bring these experiences to the broader APAC community.

PyCon APAC 2022 will be a 2-day conference: 2 days of regular presentations organized in 3 tracks and 1 track for tutorials and workshops. We plan to organize a virtual conference powered by Gather Town, YouTube, and Discord by default. *If the government policy and regulation allow, then the on-site conference will be considered.*

### B.1 About PyCon Taiwan

PyCon Taiwan is an annual convention in Taiwan for the discussion and promotion of the Python programming language. It is held by enthusiasts and focuses on Python technology and its versatile applications. We welcome people interested in Python to join PyCon Taiwan to share knowledge, exchange ideas, make connections, and help us grow our network.

To date, PyCon Taiwan committee had organized 2 PyCon APAC (2014 - 2015) and 8 PyCon TW (2012 - 2013, 2016 - 2021).

### B.2 About Open Culture Foundation (OCF)

The Open Culture Foundation (OCF) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization founded in 2014 by several of Taiwan's open source community members. Our main goal is to support local communities advocate the use of open technologies in broader sectors, including open-source software, open hardware, and open data. In addition, we help governments, enterprises, and NGOs better understand the benefits of adopting open source and promote the importance of open data to the public sphere. We believe that a culture of open collaboration is the foundation for an innovative society and the engine of participatory democracy.

Since its establishment, OCF has supported local communities to run large-scale conferences, seminars, and hackathons and collaborate with several international offices and multilateral institutions to deepen Taiwan's connection to the global open culture community. Our past collaboration partners include the American Institute in Taiwan, British Office Taipei, Bureau Francais de Taipei, and the World Bank. OCF also has strong connections with the global open source community and regularly exchanges experiences with civic tech groups worldwide. Our mission is to build bridges between local and international "open" communities and hope to act as a mediator for open culture.

### B.3 Python Communities in Taiwan

The events were held at restaurants or coffee shops until later Microprogram Co. supported the event venue. The events are held monthly on Saturday afternoon, which is best suited for a walk to have some snacks in Fengjia Night Market after the event.
- **[Tainan.py](http://www.meetup.com/Tainan-py-Python-Tainan-User-Group/) (Tainan, Taiwan)**
Joe, who moved to Tainan in 2013, founded [Tainan.py](http://tainan.py/). Decided to co-organize a gathering with the MOSUT community in Tainan to become "[Tainan.py](http://tainan.py/) Ã— MOSUT". The gathering is held once a month, usually on weekend afternoons. [Tainan.py](http://tainan.py/) will promote local delicacies so that everyone can enjoy the local flavors.
- **[Kaohsiung.py](http://www.meetup.com/Kaohsiung-Python-Meetup/) (Kaohsiung, Taiwan)**
Before establishing [Kaohsiung.py](http://kaohsiung.py/), Victor Gau participated in the [Tainan.py](http://tainan.py/) event until he collided with a locomotive, giving Victor the idea of establishing a community in Kaohsiung. In 2014, Victor launched [Kaohsiung.py](http://kaohsiung.py/). Arranging experts to share on Saturdays from time to time, he would pick one Monday every month to meet at Wenzao.
- **[Hualien.py](http://www.meetup.com/Hualien-Py/) (Hualien, Taiwan)**
In 2013, Wei Zeren felt that there was a lack of open source in the east and began to invite Python speakers from all over the world. With the willingness of Mosky, [Hualien.py](http://hualien.py/) started smoothly in 2014. Apart from speech sharing, there are also free gatherings and workshops on specific topics in the current form of gatherings.
- **[Nantou.py](https://www.facebook.com/%E5%8D%97%E6%8A%95python-113209870215893/) (Nantou, Taiwan)**
Led by the Vice President of the Nan Kai University of Technology, Prof. Cheng-Min Lin, [Nantou.py](http://nantou.py/) has regularly held a monthly meeting at 768 Art Space to share the latest information and newest experiences with all the Python lovers in central Taiwan. Members have contributed their efforts to bring along industry connection as well as a selfless and boundless location for all the Python learners.
- **[PyLadies Taiwan](https://tw.pyladies.com/)**
PyLadies is a group of women developers who love Python. We are an international mentorship group focusing on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python community. We host monthly meetups with different topics, such as beginners meetups, project presentations, and tutorials. Open to all who identify as women. Feel free to join us!

*If the government policy and regulation allow, then the on-site conference will be considered.* Then, we will discuss with APAC orgranizer about date adjustment for more attendees.

### F.2 **Proposed Keynote Speakers**

We are planning to invite our keynote speakers in the following aspects:

- Core developer
- Applications of Python
- Community organizing
- Education

### F.3 **Conference Events**

- **Warm-up Events**
We invite and support speakers whose talks are qualified but declined due to limited slots at the main conference to share their thought with local communities. We plan to expand this event to the APAC area.

We will invite several speakers to give keynote speeches during the two-day conference. Each keynote speaker is considered one of the most influential figures in their respective fields. They share their professional experience and the image of their domain's future.
- **Talks**
The two conference days are packed with talks about Python by speakers from Taiwan and APAC region. Talks will be delivered across the three tracks simultaneously with diverse topics and difficulties.
- **Tutorials**
Tutorials is professional courses need to be registered. The difference between tutorials and talk is that the speaker will bring the audience to practice together, and they can communicate with each other while learning.
- **Young Inspirers**
Starting from PyCon TW 2021, we hold Young Inspirers to create a learning and communication space for young people. Let young people share their experiences and cultivate the ability of multi-thinking to exchange information between different generations.
- **Development Sprints**
A development sprint gathers open source project owners, contributors, and people who want to contribute but trying to find a place to start. Project hosts bring their unresolved issues or work-in-progress features and share them with everyone. Sprint happens before the main conference. So we expect it to get more notices and ticketing sellings to it.
- **Open Spaces**
Open Spaces are self-organizing meetup events that happen simultaneously with the main conference. You to define, organize, plan out the meetup as you prefer. Enjoy the Open Space while making new friends, chat about any topic you'd like at the same time.

We'll have lightning talks by the end of each conference day, where each speaker only gets a five-minute to share their idea! Exceeded five minutes? We'll cut off your signal.
- **PyNight**
PyNight consists of both "music" and "communication" parts. The protagonists are a group of versatile community friends, bringing their carefully prepared musical performances to everyone. In the PyNight, you can chat with like-minded friends with great music surrounding you. For online events, we will hold PyNight on Gather Town and will bring some casual activities to make us have better understandings.
- **Job Fair**
Job Fair is a job fair for engineers. Sponsors are open to introducing themselves on stage and publicizing the sponsor's needs for recruiting talents. You can talk with the sponsors more at this time, and maybe a good opportunity comes.
