your motive to become a review of your

248
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,720
reviewer

249
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,839
okay yeah so hello everyone my name is

250
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,519
kerr and i've been the pycon taiwan

251
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:24,800
committee's uh reviewer for about

252
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,240
five years since since 2017

253
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,480
and

254
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,399
my motivation behind being a reviewer

255
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,720
mainly is because i want to bridge my

256
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,519
knowledge between python

257
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,920
uh the real world usage of python and

258
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,160
also the trending in the current python

259
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,440
world and in my opinion like being part

260
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,000
of the

261
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,560
reviewer can make enable me to

262
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,720
understand like oh what kind of topic is

263
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,560
popular this year and also understanding

264
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,360
what exactly

265
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,120
uh kind of topic between pycon taiwan

266
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,639
and the the rest of python around the

267
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,279
world the difference

268
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,160
and so this year holding holding

269
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,839
uh python ipec also can kind of makes me

270
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,399
understand like oh what's the difference

271
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,760
between uh pycon taiwan's proposal

272
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,639
versus python apex resources so

273
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,519
that's

274
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,639
probably

275
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,000
the

276
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,800
my major reason to be a reviewer yeah

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,200

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,160
icon apex for

333
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,519
probably the long a long time because

334
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,399
back in singapore in 2009 we started

335
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,519
pycon apex and that was the first one so

336
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,320
i've kind of been a reviewer since yeah

337
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,279
that's the gist of it

338
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,680
okay

339
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:04,480
okay thank you

340
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,000
okay so there is a question that we uh

341
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,040
uh i want to ask first is that uh what's

342
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,040
the

343
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,920
working flow of the reviewer committee

344
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,199
and so uh

345
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,079
if

346
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:24,320
if tp can

347
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:28,240
and tell us about the working flow

348
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,199
the working flow is basically

349
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,680
um

350
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,440
after you submit the proposal

351
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,680
we'll like get it to a system right

352
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,480
there's a database for all the proposals

353
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,040
and

354
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,240
after all the proposals are correct

355
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,440
collected and the system is closed

356
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,639
uh the

357
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,959
program chair will send out

358
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,399
a bunch of like invitations for

359
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,240
reviewers

360
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,079
so that hey would you like to become a

361
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,720
reviewer and if you do

362
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,800
this is where you can find

363
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,000
all the proposals

364
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,559
and the each reviewer will go through

365
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,839
all the proposals like one by one and

366
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,600
see

367
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,039
those proposals but

368
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,480
in the in this initial phase

369
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,640
uh only

370
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,079
part of the proposal will be

371
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,079
will be will be visible to the reviewers

372
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,480
for example the

373
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,720
submitter of the proposal will be hidden

374
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,880
so the reverse won't be able to see who

375
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,720
submitted what proposal and we will kind

376
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,280
of like redact all the personal

377
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,760
informations in your proposal so all the

378
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,360
proposals become become

379
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,120
anonymous

380
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,200
and we'll

381
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,280
sort of like select

382
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
like do we like this proposal or do you

383
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,559
like

384
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,559
like if you want to take this sure but i

385
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,480
don't want to endorse it or like this

386
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,840
proposal is

387
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,440
like

388
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,840
i don't think you should

389
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,840
like accept the proposal and that's an

390
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,919
initial phase after initial after the

391
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,760
initial phase the program chair will

392
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,760
collect all the reviewers all the

393
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,960
reviews from the reviewers

394
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,840
and selects

395
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,280
like a part of the proposals that

396
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,840
no reviewers feel should be rejected

397
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,600
to enter the second phase and it's only

398
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,600
in the second phase the reverse will be

399
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,600
able to see the full detail of the

400
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,720
proposal for example the

401
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,440
draeneium background

402
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,039
whether you have given past talks of the

403
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,760
proposal

404
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,320
so basically if you have given this same

405
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,480
talk to another conference prior to the

406
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,840
submitting this proposal to

407
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,679
our conference

408
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,120
and

409
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,640
and

410
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:42,799
the reviewer will go through the same

411
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,160
process again like refine our review and

412
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,400
probably

413
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,640
communicate to the

414
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,559
to the submitter

415
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,600
to improve the proposal

416
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,000
after this second phase the

417
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,840
program chair will like end the review

418
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,080
and select the top proposals to accepts

419
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,200
yeah that's basically the workflow

420
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,760
and for each rounds the reviewer will

421
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,679
probably like

422
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,600
see what each proposal

423
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,960
or structured maybe

424
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,200
i think

425
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,919
maybe

426
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,720
we all have kind of different

427
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,720
ways of doing

428
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,679
that so i have the following questions

429
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,640
uh do reviewers work together or they

430
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,320
review

431
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,320
uh each paper on their own

432
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,120
[Music]

433
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,880
tp or tie or cur

434
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,960
you can answer the question yeah let me

435
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,480
type

436
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,880
i i think both

437
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,120
if i remember correctly at the first

438
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,240
stage we only

439
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:56,320
review the proposal anonymously but at

440
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,320
the following maybe second stage

441
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,640
you or the other reviewer could

442
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,880
choose or decide with

443
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,799
are you going to

444
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:12,240
review reveal your comments or anything

445
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:15,919
uh anonymously as well so you can choose

446
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,640
co work with the others or not both

447
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,280
yeah

448
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,000
i think like also there is no

449
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,400
there's no rule that we cannot

450
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,559
communicate with with each other but

451
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,679
most of the reviewers tend like usually

452
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,799
don't

453
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,360
i don't know

454
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,840
like why it's kind of like our habits of

455
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,840
doing it

456
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,320
direct channel to communicate with with

457
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,600
each other but we all uh communicate

458
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,240
with each other

459
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,000
via the reviewer proposal reviewing

460
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,280
system which

461
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,080
uh you can

462
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,400
choose review or your comments or not at

463
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,320
the following later stage

464
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,559
for me i don't

465
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,360
uh communicate with the other

466
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:02,480
uh the other members well very often but

467
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,640
i one of the interesting

468
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,000
interesting part for me is

469
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,640
refer to

470
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,600
the comments from the other

471
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,000
review

472
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,240
the other members of reviewing commit

473
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,280
that's very helpful for my for me as

474
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,880
well especially when i saw something i

475
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,880
didn't think of before

476
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,799
so

477
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,200
uh so you are able so all the reviewer

478
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,360
all the reviewers from the reviewing

479
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,799
committee will know who

480
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,799
gives what kinds of comments to

481
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,679
the proposal right

482
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,440
yeah hey we

483
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,120
really i

484
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,480
forgot i don't remember as second stage

485
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,600
and

486
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,159
yeah

487
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,559
second stage if i so

488
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,799
at the second stage you may know what

489
00:21:52,559 --> 00:22:00,240
kinds of uh comments that that tp have

490
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:04,559
given to kerr and uh

491
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:08,640
no no i i uh we well know the name of

492
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:11,679
the reviewer we only see some

493
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:14,240
unique id right yeah

494
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,280
right okay that makes sense yes okay

495
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,280
okay

496
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,559
so um does reviewers argue over their

497
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:27,320
comments on the same proposals

498
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:27,320
do you have this kind of experience

499
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,960
i think i remember kurt like having some

500
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,919
strong opinions on the proposal in the

501
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,080
past

502
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,799
do you remember correctly is that you

503
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,120
yeah kurt can you tell us more about the

504
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,919
story

505
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,280
oh sorry what's your question i i just

506
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:54,000
uh i i just wanna argue over a proposal

507
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,919
whether to accept the proposal or not

508
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,679
yeah

509
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,840
i think particularly this is like a

510
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,000
kind of thing

511
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,840
i can also answer your previous question

512
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,960
right do we talk offline about certain

513
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,480
things and yes we do because um

514
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,880
there's a certain situation like a sound

515
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,080
speaker may actually get some talk

516
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,640
before and we we know them and

517
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,360
we may know that kayla's talk

518
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,080
the the proposals content and the the

519
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,559
talk content may actually be

520
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,799
there may be some gap between them

521
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:34,000
and so once we learn like those speakers

522
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,120
packs past the performers in the

523
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,760
conference

524
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,600
that could be one of the factors for us

525
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,640
to discuss say

526
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,919
uh do we want to accept the sense

527
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,080
speaker again

528
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:51,360
uh given those past uh

529
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,600
positive proposal we've accepted before

530
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,279
and that's one case the other case is

531
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,960
more like uh

532
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,679
purely checking the con channel first

533
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,679
thing and uh

534
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,440
i probably will give one feedback person

535
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,360
first space i i didn't know other

536
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,159
reviewers feedback at that time and then

537
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,080
later i in the second phase i start to

538
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,919
be able to see those anonymous feedback

539
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,400
from other reviewers and i can see like

540
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,080
some viewers either part really possibly

541
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,159
about the content and

542
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,840
uh if i'm more familiar with the same

543
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,120
criteria such as

544
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,039
uh let's say

545
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,760
if i'm familiar with

546
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,480
uh let's say security and the

547
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,000
nobody feel the same process any issue

548
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,000
even some people say oh this sounds

549
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,080
really good but maybe when i look at

550
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,080
that content i noticed that i know that

551
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:38,400
oh this content is actually probably not

552
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,400
security but more like a data analysis

553
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,799
and this guy probably is not a security

554
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,159
background person but the top category

555
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,720
is wrong and

556
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,360
the the key problem here is the

557
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,640
uh after we kind of

558
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,760
understand the background of this

559
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,520
speaker maybe it's even uh goes

560
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,760
another extreme case

561
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,919
in that case i may kind of uh contact to

562
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:06,240
uh other program committee members to

563
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:08,960
talk about that hey uh this thing i feel

564
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,480
i have certain concerns and even i see a

565
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,960
lot of positive feedback from other

566
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,960
reviewers and so that sort of situation

567
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,960
also happened during our review

568
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,799
okay thank you

569
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,960
so um

570
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,760
you have talked about the

571
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,200
the

572
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,600
process that you and criteria that the

573
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,799
process that you've been reviewing a

574
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,520
proposal

575
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,919
so

576
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,039
i think many people will want to know

577
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,840
the

578
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,279
um

579
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,960
what's the criteria that you

580
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,840
will

581
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,039
you will consider in reviewing the

582
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,240
proposals

583
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,600
do you have

584
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,559
a standard criterias for each proposals

585
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,840
or

586
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,720
um

587
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,960
do you

588
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,559
yeah

589
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,919
uh

590
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:04,320
yeah do you have any criterias

591
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:06,400
uh okay this maybe let's start with tp

yeah okay sure can you hear me

601
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,279
yes

602
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,080
okay so um

603
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,080
for me the

604
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,880
proposal um can i actually visualize

605
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:47,039
that means does it have enough

606
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,559
i'm sorry i can't get my job here

607
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,559
maurice

608
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:53,360
can you hear me can you hear me now

609
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,360
yeah

610
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,799
okay so um

611
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,720
my first and major criteria is

612
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,400
once i get the pro when i read the

613
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,640
proposal does it can i kind of imagine

614
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,120
the talk will be like that's the first

615
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,039
thing does it have enough content for me

616
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,720
to decide what the talk was going to be

617
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,120
like that's a that's the most important

618
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,279
criteria for me

619
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,279
yep

620
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,520
yeah okay so on to the second that yeah

621
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,120
it's

622
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,240
basically the

623
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:31,200
the kind of proposal that will

624
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,600
be the most likely to be accepted is the

625
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,279
one that we can sort of see someone on

626
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,200
the stage talking about this stuff

627
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,799
without you actually standing on the

628
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,039
stage

629
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,440
if you can achieve that in your proposal

630
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,720
you're very likely to be accepted and on

631
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,360
the contrary if we just if you just have

632
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
maybe a topic and have

633
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,600
your content in

634
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,080
improvs like for example like a blog

635
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:58,159
post and we have no idea how this will

636
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,279
be talked about or organized on stage

637
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,520
then

638
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,159
we will probably think

639
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,000
for a while before deciding whether to

640
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,840
accept you or not

641
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
so it's

642
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,520
most likely like

643
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,440
put your proposal in talk form like how

644
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,039
you would talk about it on stage would

645
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,880
be the best

646
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,880
way to organize your proposal

647
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,159
okay so uh do do

648
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,159
anyone want to

649
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,520
to share their

650
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:36,559
review criteria with us

651
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,440
yeah i would like to add one more

652
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,159
uh the diversity um because python

653
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,559
serves us the general purpose language

654
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,840
and we are python conference rather than

655
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,760
a data conference or something so i paid

656
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,640
myself i personally

657
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,640
uh focus on

658
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,120
topic diversities as well so i will pay

659
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,480
attention on

660
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,679
the topic

661
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,840
that

662
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,240
uh

663
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,960
that's not very common or

664
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,039
not many people talks about that this

665
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,679
year so if

666
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:15,039
so i will try to pick up topic like that

667
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:18,720
in case uh people are too

668
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:21,039
uh for focusing on for example uh ai

669
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,000
machine learning this year and i don't

670
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,200
want

671
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,840
i i

672
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,799
i personally

673
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,880
don't uh

674
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:33,120
don't want that happen

675
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,120
too much so diversity

676
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,200
so it's better

677
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,799
okay okay sorry let me add one thing or

678
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,320
to go by others

679
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,720
so

680
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,080
my personal criteria is simple is

681
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,120
why this proposal need to be in pycon

682
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,200
and why this year let's do quite just

683
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,399
basically if your proposal can answer

684
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,120
these two questions

685
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,320
likely it will hardly be selected

686
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,320
because

687
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,480
you understand why

688
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,840
you want why this topic is not in other

689
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,080
conference that

690
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,640
likely be the content is related to

691
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,240
python or the content is

692
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,880
updated and the at least in certain part

693
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,200
of the content is related to python and

694
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,360
the other thing is why need to be in

695
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,480
this year it's also because okay right

696
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,640
now if you go to

697
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,120
search your video i'll search a certain

698
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,679
topic with a video resource you can find

699
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,000
a lot of them and so the question here

700
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,120
is like okay so you want to talk about

701
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,399
one top

702
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,200
topic but

703
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,200
if that topic it's already there and

704
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,520
then the question is uh what's the

705
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,720
difference between the topic

706
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:47,200
in there versus your topic um the

707
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,960
situation actually goes more extreme

708
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,520
during the pandemic because the

709
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,240
conference goes online and those online

710
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,799
resources it's getting more

711
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,440
not really touched people in person this

712
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,200
situation is not that extreme in a

713
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,440
previous situation because

714
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,039
we are happy to accept the same topic

715
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,240
although it's talked in another

716
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,120
conference

717
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,760
so

718
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:14,159
this is basically my two criteria

719
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,799
why pycon and why this year yes

720
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,240
okay thank you thank you kur

721
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,080
so uh let me quickly wrap this question

722
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,200
uh so um

723
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:28,159
if you want to be edited by the

724
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,120
reviewers uh you have to prepare enough

725
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:34,080
content for the reviewers to know that

726
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:37,039
this is a very serious proposal and

727
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,840
second is that you have to tell a story

728
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,640
to make uh the reviewers

729
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,559
uh think this is an interesting

730
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,200
topic and

731
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:51,919
maybe uh if maybe uh

732
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,519
we will accept more of the diver

733
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,640
more diverse

734
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,600
topic

735
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,440
with

736
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,640
our proposal and lastly that uh it's

737
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,480
important that you know why this topic

738
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,440
uh is

739
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,960
uh important

740
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,919
that uh

741
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,519
we have to accept our proposal this year

742
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:18,960
okay i think okay i think

743
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,960
for me one of the

744
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,200
things about like talking about

745
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,600
like

746
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,039
having a story together with your elites

747
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,640
to convince me is not that the

748
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,440
topic is

749
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,840
particularly interesting but

750
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,799
you will talk it in an interesting

751
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,360
fashion

752
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,720
is the most is there is a more important

753
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,200
criterion to me

754
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:45,120
because like whether a topic is

755
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,279
interesting for example whether

756
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,200
writing a password in python major is

757
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,600
interesting whether building a website

758
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,240
in python is just interesting or whether

759
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,399
doing big data in python is interesting

760
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,360
varies from people's people

761
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:02,320
like right for example i

762
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,240
i do apocry airflow but i write the web

763
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:07,200
backends and i don't know anything about

764
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,000
data so if you are doing big data

765
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,760
your topic is by default

766
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,799
not interesting to me

767
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,679
but

768
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,840
if you can tell a story of how you use

769
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,799
big data to achieve something for

770
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,320
example like we can transition to

771
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:25,760
the next question on this is

772
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,799
one of the

773
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,480
better proposals i

774
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,519
have reviewed past years is is there's a

775
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,640
there's a

776
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,880
proposal on doing big data on like

777
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,919
sports events for example baseball i

778
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,559
forgot whether the exact sport that it

779
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,159
there was so for example they

780
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,360
the the submitter

781
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,480
used

782
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,120
big data to analyze baseball player

783
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,279
behavior and plays and things like that

784
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,559
and i know nothing about that

785
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,799
that topic

786
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,440
but the story was good

787
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,240
so the proposal was good for me

788
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,440
yeah um i would like to a second uh

789
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,440
teepees

790
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,480
comments as well

791
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,240
i

792
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,440
yeah and i re i i

793
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,720
i'm not an expert at big data as well

794
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,159
but uh

795
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,240
good story

796
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,280
also helps me to understand why are you

797
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,639
going to

798
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,520
achieve and what python

799
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,800
serves your purpose so we can still a

800
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,440
good story could steal back to serve

801
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,399
python itself to make more people know

802
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,000
how and what python could achieve

803
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,200
rather than just

804
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,639
spread

805
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,839
the knowledge

806
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:43,679
really specific to big data itself

807
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,359
if we would like to

808
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,040
distribute overspread big data

809
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:50,800
technical

810
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,639
knowledge those are

811
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,399
the two phrases i use the most in my

812
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,680
reviews

813
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,280
yeah yes speaking of the numbers uh if i

814
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,720
remember correctly

815
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,960
there is also a number shown on the

816
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,359
system to tell us

817
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,320
how many people

818
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,800
has

819
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,320
reviewed the purpose already

820
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,960
so we can know

821
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,240
which which topic has been covered which

822
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,760
proposed so need more reviews so we can

823
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,520
make sure the

824
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,720
quality

825
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,640

programmed sharing in one year so if the

829

wants to review a certain proposal

831
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,200
the chair can just invite more reviewers

832
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,040
to do that yeah yeah yeah

833
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,520

okay okay thank you for answering this

837
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,720
question

838
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,359
and i think uh we can head over to some

839
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,280
of the question on slido

840
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:01,920
okay and

841
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,280
here is a question that

842
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,079
is related to this topic

843
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,880
that

844
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:11,359
is for maurice uh is

845
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,400
morris willing to share

846
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:17,599
his proposal reviewing experience

847
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:22,720
especially regarding using the review

848
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:24,720
system of pycon taiwan for ipac friends

849
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,400
maurice can you answer these questions

850
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,200
with for us

851
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,560
yeah

852
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,800
i'll try

853
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,720
i try so um

854
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,599
based on previous year when i was re

855
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,599
oops

856
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,000
there's actually two steps one the first

857
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:44,000
step is we look at the pro

858
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,280
and kind of have a gauge of weather

859
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,359
as what mentioned just now besides

860
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,440
paint a clear picture

861
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,599
maybe one of the

862
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,400
another question is

863
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,839
do i want to hear this

864
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,680
if i want to hear this talk then i'll

865
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,000
read it

866
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,520
i mean that's the kind of

867
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,560
thing that we have so

868
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,839
um

869
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:11,520
which means that

870
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,520
my tips for anyone right

871
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,680
and see whether does your friend want to

872
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,720
hear your talk

873
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,839
that's the first thing you need to pass

874
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,480
your friend first

875
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:25,839
then

876
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:28,000
i think the re the review process is

877
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,520
gentle so i would say that it's very

878
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,359
harsh

879
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,760
compared with

880
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,760
first year

881
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,880
yeah it's less more gentle this day

882
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,480
yeah

883
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,480
so i think that is a that's a plus

884
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,920
it's whether that's the

885
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,520
do i want to hear the trouble

886
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,320
yeah yes i think morris morris talk

887
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
about

888
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,599
being

889
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,480
being more gentle these days

890
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,960
i think that's that really happens

891
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,560
a lot these days in like various piping

892
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,560
communities we are

893
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,440
generally becoming more gentle these

894
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,440
days yeah

895
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,480
okay thank you maurice and tp i'm sorry

896
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,560
my airpods is weird i i think i didn't

897
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,320
hear

898
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,800
more

899
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,480
people as well so yeah

900
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:32,720
probably the connection has some issues

901
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:35,280
yeah yeah yeah okay um

902
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,280
okay so think thanks for maurice for

903
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,000
answering and answering these questions

904
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,000
with for us

905
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,520
so uh i think we can

906
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,760
start with some question on the top

907
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,920
uh the the first question is could i ask

908
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,440
questions in mentoring okay

909
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,440
it's a bit late

910
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,280
it's a bit late to answer this but the

911
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,640
answer is yes

912
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,000
yes

913
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,200
if if anyone here want to ask questions

914
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,960
in mandarin

915
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,000
feel free to open

916
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,720

00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,920
okay

919
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,000
and the second one any tips for the

920
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,920
first time speaker to make their

921
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,520
proposal more attractive and

922
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,680
professional

923
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,920
um i i think i think we yeah should have

924
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,079
covered this before yeah

925
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,599
make it like a talk knock

00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,880
knob and blog post another article

927
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,880
i i i provided an additional information

928
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,520
for this question

929
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,760
uh if it's technical

930
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,280
uh technical talk

931
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,119

and if it's a soft

935
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,920
soft talk like sharing some

936
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,920
experiments regarding for example

937
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,680
regarding organizing a

938
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,200

um

941
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,800
for example

942
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:06,720
a

943
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:10,079

948
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,359

uh

968
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,839
summarize the talk into a proposal and

969
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,200
start from there it can improve their

970
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,760
content

971
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,480
and the second thing i do

972
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:21,119
hope i do hope but not necessarily

973
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,359
you can add this information say i'm the

974
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,880
first first time speaker

975
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,240
into your

976
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,760
background

977
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,040
self introduction

978
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,240
and when we see that in the second phase

979
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,079
uh for me it's a positive signal maybe

980
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,800
it's not for others but for me it's like

981
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,920
a i feel icon should always have new

982
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,839
speakers so if you are new definitely uh

983
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,520
i will take a look more and maybe give

984
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:47,839
you more situation

985
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:49,280
to improve the proposal even though it's

986
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,520
not accepted

987
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,280
yeah

988
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,720
right so if you are

989
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,599
like

990
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,119
yeah a few years ago we wanted to do a

991
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:01,920
first

992
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:03,440
first time submitter workshop

993
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,599
so if you have never submitted a

994
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,319
proposal we do a workshop to help you

995
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,400
improve the proposal but we never really

996
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:12,800
ended up doing that

997
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,599
but we can still like help you on a

998
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,520
person-to-person basis right

999
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,680
if you don't know what to do we can

1000
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,440
teach you right

1001
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,079
but here's

1002
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,640
actually one important important thing i

1003
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,520
would say i don't know other kungs but i

1004
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,920
think this is very unique in our systems

1005
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,119
we provide feedback to the proposals

1006
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,839
submitter

1007
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,760
so

1008
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,319
other conference in my experience is the

1009
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,200
either just tell me you you got accepted

1010
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,760
or you are rejected there's no such that

1011
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,880
you got rejected but because of what

1012
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,920
reason

1013
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,160
so i think uh especially we have two

1014
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,720
phases that means in the second phase

1015
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,200
you can see the feedback why people hate

1016
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,400
or like your type your proposal

1017
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,680
and i i do i do suggest

1018
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,079
anyone if you really have any idea

1019
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,200
uh please submit it because you at least

1020
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,640
can get some feedback from the reviewers

1021
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,680
yeah exactly

1022
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,079
exactly

1023
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,800
i think i remember

1024
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,119
there are instances that the proposal

1025
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,800
that the initial proposal was

1026
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,200
literally trashed

1027
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,880
in the first phase of the review but

1028
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:27,440
the the proposal is a little bit harsh

1029
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,520
but the proposal got better so much in

1030
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,720
the second phase it eventually got

1031
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,119
accepted

1032
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,359
that happened

1033
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,839
feel free to feel free to submit your

1034
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:41,319
proposal learn a lot either way

1035
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:43,760
yeah and to be honest i feel

1036
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:45,119
accomplishment i accomplished this as

1037
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,000
well when i

1038
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,079
saw the proposal

1039
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,520
it's not that good

1040
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,920
at the first stage but it becomes much

1041
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,040
much better at second stage i think this

1042
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,119
is the

1043
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,960
most interesting part

1044
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:06,960
as a proposal reviewer as well we feel

1045
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,960
we are helping the community

1046
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,480
yeah we're

1047
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,839
not trying to be

1048
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,720
gatekeepers like deciding who are

1049
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,880
we're

1050
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,000
like worthy of giving a talk we are

1051
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,240
trying to

1052
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,240
make the talk worthy

1053
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,240
of presented yeah yeah

1054
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,720
yeah i really like the uh the idea tv

1055
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:33,119
just talked about uh review er community

1056
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,119
reviewing community is not a gatekeeper

1057
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,480
it's not like

1058
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,319
we're not going to

1059
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,480
do something like oh this this part is

1060
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,359
good you are good you are bad you are

1061
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,760
good yeah not trying to categorize

1062
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:48,160
uh people proposals

1063
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,480
we are trying to boost

1064
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:54,240
the whole community

1065
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,960
with better python quality a python

1066
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,440
experience quality to share with it with

1067
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,440
the others

1068
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,760
okay maybe i can add something is my

1069
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:09,200
mind better now i'm yeah much better

1070
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,079
so yeah finally got home um so i think

1071
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,520
just to add on will be

1072
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,359
don't don't see the reviewer as

1073
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,680
kind of trying to nitpick you

1074
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,200
think about think of the reviewer as

1075
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,359
trying to help you

1076
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,800
to get a better proposal out of it and

1077
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,000
to help you shape

1078
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,800
you know

1079
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:30,160

1084
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,119

will consider no no

1106
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,640

interesting

1112
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,680
fact i think

1113
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:48,079
yeah i think it's also answer

1114
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,400
another question below like how to

1115
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,000
how do we define a good

1116
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,720
reviewer

1117
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,720
well i will say one of the personality

1118
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,880
will be you're more

1119
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:01,280
uh you're not nitpicking people you are

1120
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,640
helping people helping people

1121
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,640
in a pilot community

1122
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,520
okay

1123
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,720
okay thank you all for

1124
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:17,440
answering the question and the then thai

1125
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:21,760
has just uh shared a very interesting

1126
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:24,400
fact of pycon taiwan community

1127
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,960
okay so um

1128
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,880
so i think the whole point is that we

1129
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,400
have to uh the review committee have

1130
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,599
the

1131
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,800
like the

1132
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,520
they

1133
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,280
they want to help the community to

1134
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,839
become better

1135
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,040
quality to have better quality

1136
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,440
that and

1137
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,480
that will be a

1138
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:52,800
a cycle and making everything better and

1139
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:55,359
better right and there is a similar idea

1140
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:57,599
in europe python that they have a

1141
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:59,359
mentorship program on

1142
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,480
mentoring the

1143
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:03,440
the

1144
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:06,400
first time speaker i think that's

1145
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,200
uh like very similar idea

1146
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,319
with

1147
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,319
what you have just

1148
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,000
told us

1149
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,920
okay yeah so i think we tried to do that

1150
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,839
a few years ago but we don't have enough

1151
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,079
viewers to do that

1152
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:24,720
at this point in time maybe we can do

1153
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:28,720
that one day

1154
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:33,200
so i think there is one question that

1155
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:36,079
is asking about how to become a reviewer

1156
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,520
and i didn't remember where the question

1157
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,680
is

1158
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:42,160
so is there any criteria to become a

1159
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,160
reviewer

1160
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:46,559
[Music]

1161
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:49,520
yes you have to email us to say you want

1162
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:52,079
to become a reviewer

1163
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,000
or you have ever

1164
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:57,280
you shared a really good

1165
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,319
or impressive talk before so the program

1166
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,160
team

1167
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:03,599
as far as i know the program team will

1168
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,680
proactively reach out to you if you are

1169
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,680
willing to share and you have already

1170
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,000
shared some really good talks

1171
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,800
publicly

1172
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,640
but if you don't like if you never got

1173
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,240
contacted by the program reviewer but

1174
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,880
you think you are good reader are you

1175
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,640
really think someone is a good reviewer

1176
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,720
just email us we'll make them one

1177
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,559
they okay the program team does not

1178
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:29,119
reach out to you because

1179
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:32,559
uh they volunteer as far as i know the

1180
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,839
volunteer pool manpower is kind of limit

1181
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:36,800
there are only few

1182
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,640
volunteers working on this so

1183
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,640
it doesn't mean you are not good it

1184
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,599
doesn't mean you are not good it just

1185
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,760
means

1186
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,400
they have limited resources reach out to

1187
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,400
you yet

1188
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,920
i think if anyone is interested in

1189
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,640
becoming a reviewer

1190
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,960
and you can reach out to

1191
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,960
our review committee

1192
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,040
right now

1193
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,880
okay

1194
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,520
discord

1195
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,119
yeah discord or email

1196
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,599
yeah

1197
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:13,920
okay let's get back to our

1198
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:16,480
uh top questions any okay this question

1199
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:20,480
has been answered

1200
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:23,440
and could you share some do and do not

1201
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:27,200
when submitting a proposal

1202
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,079
i think you have shared some some dues

1203
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,040
and

1204
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,920
you have some do not

1205
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,920
to

1206
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:38,319
share with uh for this question

1207
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:39,280
i may probably

1208
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:43,520
share

1209
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:44,400
a harsh example and do not

1210
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,079
sell

1211
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,280
your product we can tell we definitely

1212
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,640
can tell

1213
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:55,520
we we encourage everyone to promote

1214
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,640
the project you have achieved but do not

1215
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,680
simply trying to sell something

1216
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,720
without

1217
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,240
it

1218
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,480
it is

1219
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,480
is

1220
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:10,000
the mindset is very important

1221
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:12,079
we can tell you are simply trying to

1222
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,400
share in something really good to the

1223
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,599
others or you are

1224
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,000
not

1225
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:21,520
you are trying to gain

1226
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,520
gaming getting something from the others

1227
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,599
i thought like i feel like i can tell

1228
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,599
that i'm not sure what the other

1229
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:29,520
things

1230
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:33,119
i think there's a word for that

1231
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:36,079
informaticos i think is the words right

1232
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,640
it's like kind of like those tv programs

1233
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:41,040
like they feel like they are

1234
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,200
kind of sharing some information but in

1235
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,599
the end they're just trying to sell the

1236
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,200
products those are kind of the proposals

1237
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,000
we don't want to see

1238
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,200
but let me let me offer some balanced

1239
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,280
opinion

1240
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,079
i also saw some

1241
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,760
proposals that regarding

1242
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:01,119
um it is

1243
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,720
it also trying to sell selling something

1244
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:06,160
but to be honest

1245
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,599
the thing they want to sell it's really

1246
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,920
good

1247
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,800
and that's no problem yeah but most of

1248
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,839
the time to be honest it's very hard to

1249
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,119
achieve

1250
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,040
do this

1251
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,920
this yeah i think the step balance i

1252
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,000
think that one one thing is that like we

1253
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,760
all see like a lot of youtube videos

1254
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,599
these days right there are some youtube

1255
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,640
video contains per contains paid

1256
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,040
promotion

1257
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,599
right there's those kind of videos

1258
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,599
but there are good promotion videos and

1259
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,920
bad promotion videos some some of the

1260
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,160
promotion videos say hey i can dig this

1261
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,559
like i know he's trying to sell me

1262
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,680
something but i'm still happy to watch

1263
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,839
this video

1264
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,400
those are the kind of performance we are

1265
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:48,240
looking for even if you it's okay if you

1266
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,000
want to sell something we all need to

1267
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,200
like put dinner on the table

1268
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,240
but

1269
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,240
it's how we do it

1270
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:02,720
okay so do you have any um i mean uh

1271
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,559
is there any positive

1272
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,559
possibility that you put

1273
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:12,400
somebody in a

1274
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,440
black list after they do something uh

1275
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,520
with

1276
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,760
anything

1277
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,000
i mean uh if i

1278
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,440
submit a proposal and um

1279
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,559
do something that you are you are really

1280
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,200
not like

1281
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,839
then will you blacklist

1282
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,839
that person

1283
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,720
i don't have a blacklist but i know some

1284
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,319
reviewers do

1285
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,880
let's put it that way

1286
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:41,119
i i don't have these kind of blacklists

1287
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,839
as well well the reason is

1288
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,000
very straightforward because maintaining

1289
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:48,640
a black business is not very easy for me

1290
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,880
so but yeah but i can tell immediately

1291
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,440
this this is a good or

1292
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,680
not that good proposal

1293
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,760
in terms of blackness i don't have one

1294
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,319
but like

1295
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,359
in some proposal i will see reviews like

1296
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:06,480
this person did this like in this year

1297
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:08,720
like in 2018 so maybe we don't want to

1298
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,200
like so i know they have

1299
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,559
they maintain some sort of list but i

1300
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,880
don't have one

1301
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,880
but some people do and like we

1302
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,440
communicate each other like reviewers

1303
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,440
talk to each other so

1304
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,599
and to be honest with google knows

1305
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:26,400
google knows we

1306
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:29,920
i used to googling

1307
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,920
some topics if when i

1308
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,040
when i was reviewing

1309
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,319
i get used to googling the similar topic

1310
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,119
only

1311
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:40,559
so

1312
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,559
google knows a lot of things

1313
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,480
okay

1314
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,880
i think

1315
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,440
okay okay

1316
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,599
if we add to the point i think the only

1317
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,400
the biggest no-no is

1318
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,520
um

1319
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,520
if there's no turn up

1320
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,040
all right

1321
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,200
yeah you know

1322
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,799
right it doesn't put anyone in good

1323
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,680
light in

1324
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:05,760
the

1325
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,920
organizing committee and at that day

1326
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,559
we'll have to figure out okay where on

1327
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,839
earth this speaker is kind of thing

1328
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,079
and realize that this speaker is not

1329
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,359
there then we have to shift the schedule

1330
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,640
and all this

1331
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:19,520
yes after

1332
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,200
one or especially if it is sadly if it's

1333
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:24,559
from the same institute then you're a

1334
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:27,119
bit more worried about it the next round

1335
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:29,040
yeah so that happened as well

1336
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,200
yeah that happened

1337
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,880
okay so it's better not to

1338
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,359
do these

1339
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,880
uh bad things

1340
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:41,440
if you want to be selected as a speaker

1341
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:43,200
if there's any reason that you know

1342
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,079
the speaker cannot

1343
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,720
come

1344
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,520
then it is always better to

1345
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,960
email or let the organizing committee

1346
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,520
know even

1347
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,799
the morning of the day itself you know

1348
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,960
the last

1349
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:58,559
i mean to me it's the last thing is me

1350
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,920
trying to hunt for where on earth for my

1351
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,440
speakers

1352
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,799
right right right yeah that's the worst

1353
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,000
thing

1354
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:08,079
yeah

1355
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,240
okay so next question

1356
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:13,200
uh could you share one of the best

1357
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:16,079
proposals you ever review and why it

1358
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:18,319
catch your eyes

1359
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,319
um

1360
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:23,280
maybe kerr

1361
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,880
i feel like curry is probably the best

1362
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,839
candidate to answer this question

1363
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,839
because he got the best proposal last

1364
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,839
year

1365
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,559
but

1366
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,400
yeah for this question i

1367
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:41,119
i think i would say it's a bit

1368
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,280
contradict to my i would say

1369
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:46,559
the proposal that can

1370
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,799
get earn points from me i thought but

1371
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:50,000
uh the best proposal i would ever think

1372
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:53,119
i would say

1373
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:55,680
not only one but most of the proposal i

1374
00:56:53,119 --> 00:57:00,079
100 feel is nice

1375
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:02,480
it's because again it's updated i am in

1376
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:05,920
that area i understand this topic is

1377
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:08,079
updated and secondly is comprehensive

1378
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,040
and comprehensive here means that there

1379
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:13,760
is a online section and the

1380
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,200
proposal likely filled all the details

1381
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,319
plus the

1382
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,720
uh

1383
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:20,319
time estimation of each detail

1384
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,160
and that for me is

1385
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:25,440
i would say generally you don't need to

1386
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:28,079
do that detailed proposal but if you do

1387
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,359
that and if you really assure what you

1388
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:32,880
plan to talk

1389
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:35,119
uh that will definitely i would say be

1390
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,200
a top over the top

1391
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:39,599
and

1392
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:41,599
yeah i think that's the simple answer

1393
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,040
for this question yeah

1394
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,640
okay thank you

1395
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:50,240
and i think we we only have one

1396
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:52,079
one answer for this question

1397
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:55,119
because we're i want you running out of

1398
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:57,920
time i want to hear about maurice's

1399
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:01,359
experience like okay once

1400
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:03,520
can you share your experience

1401
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:06,720
um about what

1402
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,960
okay about the best proposal

1403
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,960
is

1404
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,839
um

1405
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:16,000
i cannot pick up something in my mind

1406
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:17,599
but i think the proposal that tends to

1407
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,440
strike me is

1408
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,520
um in fact

1409
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,200
at least there was one or two proposals

1410
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:26,480
i've been through

1411
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,400
it was clear enough exactly what the

1412
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,160
speaker is talking so even they'll put

1413
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:31,680
down this

1414
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,640
it's almost like the

1415
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,400
the header of your powerpoint slide so

1416
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,559
he will even put down what it is how

1417
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,240
many minutes that man's gonna talk for

1418
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:42,000
so you have a like

1419
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,400
six or seven points and then you can

1420
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,440
literally just know what he's trying to

1421
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,319
say

1422
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,200
you know

1423
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:50,559
just by that alone in fact

1424
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,880
i think that's a that's the best

1425
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:54,640
proposal i've seen so far

1426
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,640
which means that you actually have a

1427
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,559
talk in mind before he writes the

1428
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:01,760
proposal

1429
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:01,760
and not the other way around

1430
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:08,400
okay

1431
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:12,559
i think i can one thing there is uh

1432
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:14,720
generally if you write a proposal before

1433
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,079
you really have the content

1434
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:19,200
and likely

1435
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:21,680
it it's really hard to be best

1436
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,520
if you already have a content you just

1437
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:26,079
try to summarize the content into a

1438
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,720
proposal that generally i mean as a

1439
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:33,079
reviewer we understand it so

1440
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:33,079
it's kind of tip as well

1441
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,280
i think one of the talks

1442
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,119
that is

1443
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,319
that we we went through that's actually

1444
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,280
very good because

1445
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:44,720
the talk is put in simply because the

1446
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,359
the person who is supposed to talk never

1447
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:50,640
come okay so

1448
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:51,599
this guy was giving a talk on um

1449
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,280
the

1450
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:57,200
what the 10 10 security

1451
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,359
pitfalls in django or something like

1452
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,839
that and he has given this talk before

1453
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:04,400
so just on this if he can actually write

1454
01:00:01,839 --> 01:00:07,920
a proposal the 10th security

1455
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,520
um look post or what it's just 0.1.2.3

1456
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,119
i think that would be a good proposal by

1457
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,960
itself

1458
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,960
just the haters of it

1459
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,920
okay so thanks for answering these

1460
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:23,920
questions with us

1461
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:30,000
and uh

1462
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:32,960
let's pick one more question okay

1463
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,119
because i think we are uh running out of

1464
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,920
time for tonight

1465
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,240
so

1466
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,240
um

1467
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:43,680
i think this question we have answered

1468
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:46,319
it already right because you have shared

1469
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:48,480
many experience of your reviewing

1470
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:49,680
process and criteria

1471
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,280
and

1472
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,440
how complete

1473
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,640
should a proposal be i think this

1474
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,000
question

1475
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,520
we have covered this question

1476
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,559
in the previous

1477
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,079
session

1478
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:06,559
okay

1479
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:09,280
uh here is a question that is asking do

1480
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:12,480
practical talk is prefer such as project

1481
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:15,520
result or theoretical talk can be

1482
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:18,240
accepted such as new idea about machine

1483
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,880
learning or framework i think that's

1484
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:23,920
let's pick this one

1485
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,920
yeah plus one

1486
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:31,920
yeah i would say a

1487
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:34,319
practical proposal would be preferred

1488
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,880
but theoretical proposals are still

1489
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:39,040
needed like we need a balance in the

1490
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,440
conference so we need both

1491
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:44,880
but if we have both then we probably

1492
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:47,440
would prefer practical ones

1493
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,880
look like i want to i want to mention

1494
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,400
the practical

1495
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,119
uh

1496
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,400
i'll say the truth is if you are a

1497
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,039
nobody

1498
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:59,200
uh practical talk is preferred

1499
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:01,599
but if you are a

1500
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:04,319
big figure in the community then

1501
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,960
definitely

1502
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:08,480
yeah i think it's less about whether you

1503
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,559
are known or not

1504
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,400
but more about like if you want to give

1505
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,079
a theoretical talk

1506
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,200
make sure you know what you're talking

1507
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:19,280
about because the reviewers are like

1508
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,599
probably not me but they're like for

1509
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,680
example for a machine learning

1510
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,960
we have machine learning experts in the

1511
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,720
reviewers

1512
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,480
so make sure you know what you're

1513
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,880
talking about if you want to submit such

1514
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,640
a proposal because you'll be trashed by

1515
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:36,319
them if you are

1516
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,319
just like trying to baffling us

1517
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:45,520
okay one uh funny things happened before

1518
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,440
uh because we have experts in our

1519
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:48,400
community

1520
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,359
it's not me

1521
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,480
um

1522
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:55,440
for example an nlp expert and also my

1523
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:58,319
experts some of them are professors in

1524
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,319
university and

1525
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,520
but in the meantime

1526
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:03,839
i know

1527
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:04,720
as a professor or a teacher they will

1528
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:07,119
kind of

1529
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,079
nitpicking or anger at

1530
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,359
seeing

1531
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,520
some

1532
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:12,240
not perfect

1533
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,799
or

1534
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:17,200
but sometimes the comments are too harsh

1535
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:18,799
so for me it's kind of difficult to

1536
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:22,400
better to

1537
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:24,640
um firstly we would like to have

1538
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:28,319
we like the reviewer

1539
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:30,240
who is kind who is trying to helping

1540
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:33,119
the community

1541
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:36,240
is not offering harsh comments

1542
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:38,240
but in the meantime i know because of

1543
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:40,720
their job they are teachers they are

1544
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,839
professors sometimes they are really

1545
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:45,680
really

1546
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:48,319
uh they have really good

1547
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:50,640
they are really expertise so so they

1548
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:52,160
have they have a high standard for their

1549
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,720
expertise yeah they're very high

1550
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:57,720
standard they are not on purpose but

1551
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,720
so

1552
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:03,440
okay

1553
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:07,520
so practical talk means that it comes

1554
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:10,720
with a result and and a project right

1555
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:12,960
and maybe some demo with the with the

1556
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:14,160
with the talk yeah

1557
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,640
i think okay

1558
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,119
one rule of thumb is

1559
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,880
talk more about your experience because

1560
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,599
we cannot fault your experience like

1561
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,079
your experience is your experience and

1562
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:29,440
we will accept it yeah but if you want

1563
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,720
to talk about theories or principles

1564
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,680
then

1565
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,920
it starts to like you start to get

1566
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:39,119
questions like why is your theory

1567
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,960
correct like those kind of things

1568
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:42,559
so be careful when you're trying to do

1569
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,480
that

1570
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:48,000
yeah okay

1571
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,760
okay uh it's important to make people uh

1572
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,559
to believe

1573
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,079
what you're talking about

1574
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,599
yeah

1575
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,440
and uh

1576
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:59,920
