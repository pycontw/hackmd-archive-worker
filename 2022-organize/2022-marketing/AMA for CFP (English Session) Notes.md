## Improvement summerize from JunWei
整理一下今天提到，下次中文AMA可以注意的地方：

1. 一開始直播可以先把 Slido 放出來給觀眾看，並示範一題的回答
2. 在進到 Slido 問答之前，可以在 Discord 問一下大家有沒有什麼問題
3. 針對下次中文AMA的問題，額外再開一個 Slido，如果太少，再從英文的複製過去
4. 直播可以在開始之前15分鐘前，先打直播，測試有無問題

之後可以規劃來做：
1. 可以把今天對 CFP 問題，整理到 FAQ 供後人觀看
2. 協助傳承這個AMA活動，衝高明年投稿數量

如果有漏掉再請幫我補充，感謝！

## Improvement summerize from PoChun

補充： 自我介紹環節不需要講背景/成為審稿委員動機，快速介紹審稿年資即可

之後可以規劃來做：
-  提前兩個月籌備宣傳
