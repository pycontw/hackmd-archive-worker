# Archive or hide notes that are inactive for a while in batch

|Suggested by|Description|HackMD Profile
|--|--|--|
PyCon Taiwan | As an organizer of community notes, I would like to archive or hide notes that are inactive for a while in batch, so people won't be swallowed by piling notes on landing page/dashboard. The archived notes could still be found via searching. | @pycontw

## Notes
- If the url links of archived notes could be dumped, that will be very helpful for users/organizers to manage all notes in the organization/community. For example, this API request [Mapping URLs of notes and their corresponding downloaded contents](/QXSnMEx6RkGDrFxFR0nCCQ)
- This request is a down-stream request of this API request [Mapping URLs of notes and their corresponding downloaded contents](/QXSnMEx6RkGDrFxFR0nCCQ)


## Misc

Keywords: automation, backup, git, github
