# 2022 Sprints Venue Instructions

The sprints venue consists of the station hall and the cars. When you first enter the venue, you will find yourself in the station hall. The opening and closing ceremonies are also held here. Each car is in charge of a project, and all developments will take place in their cars. The cars have the names of several Taiwanese cities and counties. The host of each project will work with the participants in their own car. Meanwhile, you are encouraged to visit other project cars and observe their growth processes.
