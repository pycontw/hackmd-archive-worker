### Discussion

1. Unlike the previous PyCons, PyCon APAC 2021 uploaded talks before the conference so that people could engage during the conference. What do you think about this change? Did it achieve your expectation?
2. Could you share how you promote PyCon APAC 2021 around the APAC area? Including satellite events, CfP, etc.
3. Would it be possible for you to share the experience of reaching out to sponsors, especially those who did not sponsor PyCon TH in the past?
