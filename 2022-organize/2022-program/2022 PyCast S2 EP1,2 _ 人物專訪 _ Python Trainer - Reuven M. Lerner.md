	* 方法
		* 讓數學系的學生想辦法學會使用 Python 來數理證明
		* 不知道為了學什麼而寫的象棋程式
			* tree search、neural network、演化學習、遊戲機器人...
	* 這十年來 Python 從沒幾個人使用，被推廣成一個路人皆知的程式語言
	* 寫程式變成一種基本的技能，但是平均的技術能力水準較低
		* 以專家的標準而言我們可能還不算會寫 Python，但是我們確實有使用他的能力。
		* 比喻：
			* 過去識字的人不多，所以有一個職業的人是專門來幫人讀信的，但對於識字的人來說是件很浪費的事情
			* 以奧運選手的角度來說，我們跑步的姿勢也可能是錯得離譜
	* 學程式不是為了工作而學
		* 學習程式就像是讓你多長一雙眼睛、手、腳，讓你看到/做到原本做不到的事情
		* 學習==玩，學習永遠是在沒有使用的情況下發生
		* 等到真的需要的時候才學是不好的(以騎腳踏車作為比喻)
	* **take away**:
		* 學習(教學)方法: 從很多不重要的 topic 中學習，做很多不必要的練習，讓自己學習到很多(有用跟沒用)的知識
		* 教學理念: first you learn to code, then you code to learn

- **開源社群相關的議題** (4+3)
	- **Opening**: As our program is a mandarin-centric community, let's talk about your talk in the Python US education summit this year: "How learning Chinese made me a better Python instructor". What's the motivation behind this talk? Why do you want to give such a talk in the Python community?
    - Python community in Taiwan
	    - Why do you want to connect to a non-English-centric community like us?
	        - [name=Wei] Could you share more about your talk "How learning Chinese made me a better Python instructor" in PyCon US education summit this year? Maybe we could start with introducing the education summit.
        - **Closing candidate1** Can you list the top 3 most important things for the non-English Python community to focus on for the local Python education?
	    - (可略：如果時間不允許或前面已經部分回答）**Closing candidate2** What's your perceptive on the PyCon TW and PyCast program? In particular, does the language barrier matter? How can the local community do a better job? Shall we focus more on localization or internationalization?
