# PyCon APAC 2022 Invitation Letter in Pyckage

Hey Pythonistas,

Thank you for joining Python Conference APAC 2022 (PyCon APAC 2022).

‚ÄúAwesome Python, Awesome Community‚Äù is our vision for PyCon APAC this year. The Python community did not happen overnight. It is based on interaction and growth between different communities.

PyCon Taiwan viewed ourselves as a vital Python community platform in Taiwan. In the past decade, we made a great impact on Python programmers by introducing brilliant thoughts and experiences from other Python Conferences in the world to Taiwan. We fully encourage the exchange of experience between local and international Python communities as well as encourage fellow programmers to share innovation ideas on PyCon Taiwan.

This year, we have launched several fascinating programs. Over 50 talks covering all kinds of fields such as Python Core, Applications, Best Practices and Patterns, Security, ML/Data Analysis, etc. Featuring our own metaverse on Gather Town. No matter where you are, you can be connected to Taiwanese culture. Making new friends and having the opportunities to exchange coding experience are what we hope all participants can get while engaging in the virtual world.

What‚Äôs more, we rolled out a special ticket called ‚ÄúSponsorship Pass‚Äù for the event, which will donate a portion of the fee to Python Software Foundation (PSF). The payment will be used to offer a string of benefits for the PyPI (Python Package Index), and CPython. Since PyCon is a nonprofit organization, your sponsorship is the key to maintaining the Python ecosystem, and we truly appreciate every great effort you make! You are the motivation for PyCon APAC to expand the horizon of the application of Python in all types of industries.

Since the first PyCon TW held in 2012, PyCon Taiwan has continued to host this great event for 10 consecutive years and was twice selected to be the organizer of PyCon APAC (2014, 2015). However, a great conference is nothing without a firm supporter, we truly appreciate our sponsors in helping the organization to thrive.

PyCon APAC 2022 is a self-driven organization. All the work is completed by a group of volunteers, who have dedicated their time and effort to the success of the event. As this year‚Äôs chairperson, I thank the volunteers on the behalf of PyCon APAC for their long-term promotion and contribution to PyCon Taiwan. PyCon APAC 2022 won‚Äôt come true without any support!

We present the conference gift called ‚ÄúPyckage‚Äù, to wrap up the memory of PyCon APAC 2022 for you.

- ‚ÄúPyckage‚Äù includes a t-shirt, a coaster, a roll of paper tape, a sticker book, and stickers.

Whether you are a volunteer, a long-time supporter of PyCon APAC and PyCon Taiwan, or a newbie to the conference, you are more than welcome to join the amazing journey with us. We are very excited to see all of you at PyCon APAC 2022 and hope you can have fun and make some new friends in the metaverse.

Looking forward to seeing you in person next year. Until then, live long and prosper.

Chairperson of Python Conference APAC 2022
David Yung-Sheng Lu
