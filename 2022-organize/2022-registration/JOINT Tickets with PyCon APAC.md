# JOINT Tickets with PyCon APAC

## 起因
For PyCon APAC, we want to target the person who maybe originally participated in APAC’s PyCon like KR/ JP/ NZ can also join PyCon APAC. Maybe we can have a discounted price on this ticket.


## FOCUS
- 拆帳(split the bill)(divide income)
	40鎂(includ taxes and fee)
- 結束日期 9/3 前兩個禮拜
- 不包含 pyckage，only for attendee.
- 會有一到兩個禮拜個工作天去處理

we estimate about we get 40 usd (include taxes and fee) from the joint ticket income. And

Each ticket will charge 40 USD (handling fee and taxes included)as our cost the tickets. The price range of the tickets depends on each organizer's decision. We would like you to offer the information about the participants by August 20th. for us to arrange the admissions. 
It would be noticed that the joint tickets do not include Pycon APAC 2022 Pyckage (eg. T-shirts, souvenirs...etc.)

我們預估每張合作票會收40鎂(包含手續費跟稅務)當做我們的售票成本，其售票價格就請各國合作售票的組織決定總售票價格，然後希望能8/20前能提供會眾資料方便我們整理並寄送會眾行前信跟入場資訊，並且合作票種不提供 PyconAPAC 2022 Pyckage (T-shirt,紀念品等)。
