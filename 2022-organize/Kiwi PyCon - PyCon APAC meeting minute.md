### Discussion

* Kiwi PyCon Magazine
    * Is there's a sample page that we can take a look?
    * What would be the time you expect us to provide content?
    * Do you want us to design out 2 sides ourselves? Or do you want us to provide only content and you'll do do the design for unity?
* Bundle Pass with Kiwi PyCon XI
    * Each ticket will charge 40 USD (handling fee and taxes included)as our cost the tickets. The price range of the tickets depends on each organizerâ€™s decision. We would like you to offer the information about the participants by August 20th. for us to arrange the admissions.
    * It would be noticed that the joint tickets do not include Pycon APAC 2022 Pyckage (eg. T-shirts, souvenirsâ€¦etc.)
