PyCon Taiwan | As an organizer of community notes, I would like to have the mapping table of notes and their URLs, so the organization could manage and reuse the downloaded notes further and easier. | @pycontw

- The `URLs` or say "an identifier" in this note means something like this for this note: `/QXSnMEx6RkGDrFxFR0nCCQ`. Full URL is preferred.

    - [Archive or hide notes that are inactive for a while in batch](/cWfkV5ZaSs-CphtVKNDxHQ)
