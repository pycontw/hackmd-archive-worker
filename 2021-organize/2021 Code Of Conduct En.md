# 2021 Code Of Conduct En
PyCon Taiwan is a community-driven convention for the Python programming language in Taiwan, created to facilitate discussions and exchange of ideas in the community. To provide a joyful, pleasant, and vibrant environment that creates value for all participants, we hereby publish PyCon Taiwanâ€™s Code of Conduct, which applies to all speech and action in both physical and digital venues of PyCon Taiwan. Your cooperation is necessary to help all of us to interact with respect and trust in PyCon Taiwan.

## Code of Conduct
* **Do not harass others** either verbally, physically, or otherwise. Harassment and discrimination are given zero tolerance. Each attendee should be equally respected regardless of nationality, race, language, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, physical appearance, faith, profession, seniority, political view, or intellect.

* **Appreciate each other**. Each attendee is expected to show a professional attitude, and behave accordingly. Users of Python are diverse in their professional roles, technical backgrounds, and application areas. They contribute to the technology in many different ways, some amazingly unimaginable. Opinions or actions that undervalue other members of the community are inappropriate.

* **Show consideration to others**. Sexual contents in any form are inappropriate in any conference venue, including but not limited to talks, open spaces, or social media. Words and actions originated from stereotypes are discouraged. Cell phones should be set to silent or a mode that does not annoy others in the conference rooms.

The conference organizers have the power to take appropriate actions to redirect the behavior of those who violate the Code of Conduct. Violators may be forced to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the organizers.

This Code of Conduct is approved by the organizers of PyCon Taiwan.
