Python has become a very important part of life for many of us - as the basis for making a living, as a way to enjoy programming, or as a project which brings together people. I've had the opportunity to work in all these fields in the last two decades and have learned a lot. In this keynote, I'd like to take you on a tour and share some of the insights I have gained.
