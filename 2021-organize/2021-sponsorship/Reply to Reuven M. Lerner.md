# Reply to Reuven M. Lerner

Hi there!

I'm a full-time trainer (https://lerner.co.il/), teaching Python and
data science to companies around the world.  I had the privilege to
teach a course in Taipei several years ago, and would very much like to
(re-)connect with the Python community there -- as well as advertise my
training services.

I'd thus like to discuss the possibility of being a sponsor of PyCon TW.
  (I would love to come in person, but that's obviously not possible,
given that I'm in Israel.)

Are sponsorships still available? (I realize that the conference is
taking place next month.)

I'll be off for the next two days, to celebrate the Jewish New Year.
But I'd be delighted to either e-mail or chat (Zoom/Skype/WhatsApp)
about how to sponsor your conference.

Thanks in advance!

Hi Reuven, 

This is Pinchun from PyConTW 2021 Sponsor team. We would like to thank you for reaching out to us. Many of us have subscribed to your email courses to speak fluent python. We are definitely more than happy to introduce your course to Taiwan python communities. 

We are hosting our conference on 2nd Oct and 3rd Oct and it is a bit too rush to include your courses into conference this year. However, the following are some out-of-conference events hosted by us:

(i) Podcast recording: We are currently recording our [podcast](https://open.firstory.me/user/pycast) talking about python or community related topics. Would you be interested in sharing your training/learning experience with us?

(ii) Sprints Meetup: We host our sprint session twice a year (the upcoming one will be next spring). Sponsoring sprint sessions are available, details are available on our [website](https://tw.pycon.org/2021/en-us/sponsor/prospectus). As it is an event for contributing code for open source project, it is a great occasion meeting experienced python developers in Taiwan.

(iii) Tutorials (PyConTW 2022): Besides regular talks, we also include tutorial sessions and workshop in our main conference. We would like to invite you to join our next year's conference. 

Above are some ideas for possible collaboration. Other proposals are more than welcome to discuss. Any proposal or input will be appreciated. We would like to know your expectations on sponsoring to form a  better sponsor package.

Please feel free to let me know what you think and we are more than welcome to have an online chat with you. 

Many thanks,
PyConTW Sponsor Team Pinchun
