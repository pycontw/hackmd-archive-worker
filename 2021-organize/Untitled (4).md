Hi Taihsiang Ho,

It would be our pleasure to offer Gather to you for free so that you can host PyCon Taiwan on Gather! All we ask for is that you mention that Gather sponsored the event. I've copied some information below for you to read through so you can get a better sense of what hosting a large conference/hackathon on gather would require.

I have attached a Gather Set Up Checklist for you to read through to learn about the general set up process and timeline. 

Alternatively, you can check out this article for first time hosts that guides you through the 4 steps to host your first Gather event: https://support.gather.town/help/first-time-hosts  

You can start setting up your room anytime prior to your event reservation for free. Once you're ready, you can purchase and finalize your reservation through your Dashboard. You can enter the date, time, and maximum user capacity into the dashboard to get a dynamic quote based on your event's details. 

You must create your space before you can make an even reservation! You can easily create a space in 5 minutes or less using one of our templates! To use a template, simply go to https://gather.town/create

You can experience a few of our template rooms before creating a space by clicking on the following links:
Conference Demos: Basic and Deluxe
Education Demos:  Small and Large w/ Recess Area
Office Demos: Small Cozy, Med Antique Styled, and Large Traditional 
Social Demos: Open Mic Cafe, Game Night, and Island at Night

If you want to create a completely custom map using your own aesthetic and assets, please feel free to check out:
Custom Map Creation Overview 
Best Practices for Space Design
Our various Youtube tutorials
Alternatively, you can always check out our new Help Center! 

If you are interested in this offer let us know and we'll work out the details!

Best,
Kevin T. Berry

Hi Gather Sales Team, I am Tai from the organizer team of Python Conference Taiwan (PyCon TW, https://tw.pycon.org/2021/ ). We are evaluating online conference solutions for the recent Covid flare-up last month.[1] We are very likely to convert our conference to a virtual conference, [2] and we are evaluating possible solutions. Besides PyCon Taiwan, many local open source communities and the corresponding conferences are evaluating their own possible solutions as well, including (but not limited to): - Hacks in Taiwan (HITCON) https://hitcon.org/2021/ - Students' Information Technology Conference (SITCON) https://sitcon.org/2021/ - Mobile / Open / Platform Conference (MOPCONF) https://mopcon.org/ (page of 2021 is still cooking) - Conference for Open Source Coders, Users, and Promoters, COSCUP https://coscup.org/2021 We are looking for a service that support us: - 1000+ people for each conference - 2 or 3 days for each conference - 2 ~ 5 conference listed above (depends on how many conferences shown above will join) If you are interested in sponsoring the service, please let me know via my email or: - organizers@pycon.tw - contacting Open Culture Foundation (OCF, https://ocf.tw/ ) I am looking forward to your comments!
