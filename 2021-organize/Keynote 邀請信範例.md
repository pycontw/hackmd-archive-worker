Dear ______ (邀請的Keynote稱謂),
 
I hope this email finds you well. My name is ---(發信人), keynote speaker coordinator of PyCon Taiwan 2021. I am writing this email to personally invite you to speak at our PyCon event this year, which will be held from Aug. 21 to Aug. 22 in Taipei, Taiwan.
 
We believe you exemplify the spirits of the Python community – someone who strives to support communities, to share engineering culture and welcome all backgrounds to get interested in technology and make people stay connected. As this is ~~the 10th year of PyCon Taiwan~~, we hope to have you to be our keynote speaker and to inspire more people In the community.

Typically, the keynote speech is 60 mins in length including Q&A session. Please be noted that the time slot is flexible, we will do everything to accommodate.  Also, any topic related to Python is welcomed for the keynote speech. An honorarium of NTD 20,000 (around 700 USD depending on currency exchange rate) will be paid to speakers. 

We wish to meet you in person. However, due to the uncertainty caused by the global pandemic, speakers not residing in Taiwan will be invited as remote guests. We will try our best to maximize audience engagement and make remote speakers experience meeting elements in real time. In fact, PyCon Taiwan 2020 was already run in a hybrid way, some of the speakers joined us online while attendees joined us at the venue. We also received positive feedback from Mariatta, our keynote speaker at PyCon Taiwan 2020. 

Please let us know by May 27 if you would be interested in speaking at the PyCon Taiwan 2021. Thank you for taking the time to read the email. We are very much looking forward to hearing from you.

Hello ______, (邀請之keynote稱謂)

Thank you so much for considering!

We understand (the situation caused by COVID-19 and how hard this time is.) (視情況接的句型)
However, we still have a deadline for inviting keynote speakers. So we will double-check with you before , and don’t worry if you do not have a firm decision at that time. We can discuss how long we can extend and how we can workaround. If we’re not fortunate enough to have you join PyCon Taiwan this year, we still hope you’ll consider Taiwan and will send you an invitation in the future.

(BTW, 後面是針對個人的regards)
By the way, we love the the question you post on Twitter.

def f(x=[]):
    x.append(1)
    return x
print(f(), f())

We get different answer if we use f-string.

Sincerely,
