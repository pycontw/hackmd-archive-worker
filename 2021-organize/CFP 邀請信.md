## CFP sprints邀請投稿

> from timyellow [link](https://www.meetup.com/Taipei-py/events/238139601/)

We're going to have a PyCon TW 2017 "Sprint"!
During a sprint, open source project managers will bring their projects and explain their issues or any unresolved problem. After the introduction of all projects, people find their projects of interest and get involved. By this interaction possibility, one can dig deep into projects or fields they care.

It is highly welcomed to bring one’s own project and find enthusiasts of same interest. For people with sufficient Python background who wants to join open source projects but having no clue or too shy to shout out on the mail list and public channels, sprints serve as a great chance to get involved.

Sprint Theme: Kickoff the Optimization of PyConTW Review Process!

The PyConTW just starts calling for proposal recently. We want to invite people who are interested in the job of reviewer to join us. We will introduce the underling review system of proposals in PyConTW, and how we review the proposals. Hope you to join us to optimize our review system and make PyConTW great again.

We also welcome you to bring your projects together here!

Schedule:

10:00 ~ 12:30: Setup & Introduction & Coding

12:30 ~ 13:30: Food Party

13:30 ~ 16:30: Coding

16:30 ~ 17:00: Sharing & Summary
