We encourage you to submit the proposal as early as possible. You are welcomed to submit multiple proposals.

Due to the effects of COVID-19, you can choose to give your talk or tutorial remotely. If we make sure the offline speaking will take place as scheduled, you can still decide whether to come to the meeting venue in person.

## Guidelines for Proposal Submission
### Talks
We accept a broad range of Python-related proposals from academic research to commercial projects, case studies, or soft topics such as running a community, making good communication, mental health, etc. So basically, if you are reading this, just submit your proposal!

We encourage speakers to talk about your own Python package or application, your experience of learning Python or hosting a Python community, etc. Talks on advanced topics are highly welcomed as well. For your inspiration, our committee has suggested that they‚Äôd love to see talks on the following topics: FinTech, Community, A.I, Data Analytics, IoT, Machine Learning, Testing, etc.

When considering different topics, you may be interested in reviewing selected speeches over the past few years at PyCon Taiwan.

This year, we will invite part of the unselected talks to share at the local communities. PyCon Taiwan will partially compensate for your transportation cost.

### Tutorials
Similar to talks, we don‚Äôt pose limitations on tutorial topics. This year, tutorials are free and the length has been changed to 1 hour and 30 minutes. It will be at the same time as the conference. The guideline for tutorial submission is based on the guideline for talks, so make sure you have read "[How to Propose a Talk?](https://tw.pycon.org/2020/en-us/speaking/talk/)". On top of that, We have some special requirements for tutorial submission, please refer to "[How to Propose a Tutorial?](https://tw.pycon.org/2020/en-us/speaking/tutorial/)" for more information.

## Proposals Review Process
After the Call for Proposals ends, and before the announcement of acceptance, the PyCon TW 2021 Proposals Review Committee is going to review the proposals and give scores and provide feedback. The process consists of three phases:

* **Stage 1 Review**: Reviewers are going to score and give feedback. This will last for about 2 ~ 3 weeks
* **Modification Step**: **According to reviewers‚Äô comments, you can modify your proposal through the dashboard.** This step lasts for about 1 to 2 weeks
* **Stage 2 Review**: Reviewers are going to re-score and re-give feedback to the modified proposals
### Modification Step
Between the stage 1 and stage 2 review, you can see the feedback from the reviewer. You may modify your proposal according to reviewers‚Äô comments or feedback. If you want to make your change obvious to the reviewers, you can point out the ID of the comment, and mention about what you‚Äôve modified according to the comment in the "**Supplementary**" section, e.g. "**#4: Updated the time management for xxx phase**"

If you have any questions, please contact us at program@pycon.tw.

Please note that PyCon Taiwan is a conference where the audience comes from different cultural backgrounds. Some jokes may be rude to others. If you want to add some humorous images or words to your speech, please double check if there is any possibility of offense, and refer to our Code of Conduct.
