# 2021 Sprint EN


Sprints are held out of the main conference (9/26 10:00 ~ 17:00). A sprint event gathers open source project owners, contributors, and people who want to contribute but trying to find a place to start. During a sprint, project hosts bring their unresolved issues or new features under development and share with everyone. You can join a project of your choice, or bring your own project here!

For those who already know fundamentals of Python and want to participate open source projects, but doesn't know where to start, sprints are great opportunities to get yourself involved! As for project hosts, this is a great chance for you to find people with similar interests, having face-to-face interactions with contributors, and getting new contributors to your project's development! Be prepared to get your hands dirty!


## Mode

Due to COVID-19, we will host the event on Gather Town. The project hosts can keep communicating with the attendees online. For each project, we would build a unique room on gather space. We also have a spare Google Meet link if we face a poor internet connection.
