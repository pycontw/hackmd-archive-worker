# Email for Phase II of Joint Sponsorship of Gather


[PyConTW2021] Joint Sponsorship Proposal of Community Conferences from Taiwan


Hi Kevin,

This is Tai from PyCon Taiwan. Thank you for your time in the office hour last Thursday (6/17). Here are the conferences that will use gather.town as our/their own virtual conference solution this year:

(in chronological order)
- g0v Jothon https://jothon.g0v.tw/ and https://jothon.g0v.tw/about/en/ - date: 2021/6/26 (and the following bi-monthly hackathon events in 2021), 150-250 attendees each hackathon
- Conference for Open Source Coders, Users, and Promoters, COSCUP https://coscup.org/2021 - date: 2021/7/30 - 2021/8/1, 2000 - 3000 attendees
- Students' Information Technology Conference (SITCON) https://sitcon.org/2021/ - date: 2021/9/4 1000 - 1500 attendees
- Python Conference Taiwan 2021 https://tw.pycon.org/2021 - date: 2021/10/2 - 2021/10/3, 1000 attendees. 1 or 2 sprint events of 100-ish people around 2021/9/26.
- Mobile / Open / Platform Conference (MOPCONF) https://mopcon.org (page of 2021 is still cooking) - date: 2021/10/23 - 2021/10/24, 1000 - 1500 attendees
- Hacks in Taiwan (HITCON) https://hitcon.org/2021/ - date: 2021/11/26 - 2021/11/27, 1000 attendees (please note HITCON is still regarding virtual conference as a backup solution because HITCON may still host in physical and in-person conference)


All of the conferences listed above (except HITCON, which is TBD) a.k.a. "the joint-conference team" will take Gather's sponsorship offer, and mention sponsored the event.

In order to arrange best user experience virtual conferences via gather.town, Gather will offer the joint conference team:
- Metropolis for each conference of the joint team
- Free price to support the corresponding attendee number of each conference

The joint-conference team is planning the following events to promote Gather:
1. Mentioning Gather on each conference websites of the joint team
2. Mentioning Gather on each conference social media (if any) of the joint team
3. (TBD) Mentoning Gather in rooms and spaces that are used by the conference event with basic and advanced objects in rooms and spaces. A more practical plan with more details will be provided later.
4. (TBD) A blog post summarized the experience of hosting virtual conferences with gather.town. Let us know which language (en or zh) you prefer, if any.


Some items that need Gather's help or confirmation:
- Please provide an "official" logo, banner, text description or anything you want to use for Gather promotion of branding if you don't mind. That will be very useful!
- Some conference events have planned to create multiple spaces for larger events (>500 participants, connecting with event portals). We expect Gather’s sponsorship is including multiple-space plans for those conference events. Is that right?
- Some conference events may have corresponding sprints/workshops/tutorials on different days from the "main" conference (around +- 1~2 weeks). The sprints/workshops/tutorials are around less than 50 but more than 20 people typically. May Gather's sponsorship include these associating events? If yes, we will provide the detailed dates and information of each event. The event will also mention Gather. For example (TBD): mentioning Gather on event pages, social media, and in rooms and spaces with basic/advanced objects.


We, the joint-conference team, appreciate Gather's sponsorship. We are also looking forward to the virtual conferences full of fun and love supported by Gather.


Kind regards,
Tai
The Joint-Conference Team & Python Conference Taiwan 2021
