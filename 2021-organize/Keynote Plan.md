- 魏老師
    - 演講方式: TBD
    - Title: 當大家都會 Python 時
    - Abstract:
    :::info
    First you learn to code, then you code to learn.
    十年前， PyCon Taiwan 在開始前的時代， 在學校課程中用 Python 來當程式語言，會被認為是"特別"的事。寫 Python 的人，多是自學。 PyCon 及各地 Python 社群，是以推廣和同好交流為目的。
    十年後的現在，深度學習成為顯學， Python 已經成為主流語言。 PyTorch,  TensorFlow,  NumPy, SciPy, scikit-* 成為基本詞彙。
    當大家都會 Python 時， 還需要推廣和同好交流嗎？
    除了技術上的傳教、宣傳、持續精進外，我自己推廣 Python 的初衷，是希望它能成為大家探索、學習、創作的基本技能與工具。在這個演講中，我將分享除了把 Python 當成工作產出外，將 Python 融入成生活與學習中的一些想法與經歷。

    - Title：Ideas, Visions and Reality: Looking back on 20 years of community work (想法、展望與現實：回望過去二十年的社群耕耘成果)
    - Abstract:
    :::info
    Python has become a very important part of life for many of us - as the basis for making a living, as a way to enjoy programming, or as a project which brings together people. I've had the opportunity to work in all these fields in the last two decades and have learned a lot. In this keynote I'd like to take you on a tour and share some of the insights I have gained.

    - Title: Building next-level AI assistants
    - Abstract:
    :::info
    AI assistants are the new faces of tech. We can now control our lights, play music, make an account transfer, and buy insurance from a chat or voice interface. Conversational AI opens up tech further to serve the people who were once left behind.

    Building AI assistants from scratch is very challenging. But now, we have much better tooling and infrastructure that make use of cutting-edge NLP research. In this talk, we will explore the current state of the technology: the level of experience we can provide for the end-user, the ease of building AI assistants from the dev perspective, and the maturity across different languages. We’ll also pull up our sleeves and develop an AI assistant together!
