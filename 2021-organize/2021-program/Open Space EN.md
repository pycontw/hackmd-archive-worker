# Open Space EN

Open Spaces are self-organizing meetup events that happen simultaneously with the main conference. Open Spaces are organized during the period of PyCon by attendees, which provides a way for you to define, organize, plain out the meetup as you preferred. Enjoy the Open Space while making new friends, chat about any topic youâ€™d like at the same time.

For those who have participated in previous PyCon Taiwan, Open Spaces may sound familiar to you. Yes! itâ€™s basically the good old BoF (Birds of a Feather), but with a name that is more comprehensive to new conference attendees.

## How do I participate in an Open Space?
Itâ€™s pretty easy: Just show up :)

Instead of Academia Sinica, this yearâ€™s PyCon will be hosted online at Gather Town Service. Therefore, the Open Space has its dedicated space. Just find a subject that interests you, greet with the host, and enjoy!

## Where and when are the Open Spaces?
Location: The open space area at gather town.

Time: Between the morning keynote started and afternoon keynote started of day 1 (08:55 ~ 16:15) and from the morning keynote ended till Lightning Talk of day 2 (10:30 ~ 16:40).

There can be up to 10 Open Spaces running in parallel. There are no other conferences on day 2 (14:30 ~ 15:20) so that you can enjoy the Open Spaces well.



## What Open Spaces are there?
We donâ€™t know either! Itâ€™s up to you and fellow attendees ðŸ˜‰

Just like the attendees, Open Spaces are very versatile. There are no limits to the subject of the Open Space! An Open Space can be a mani/pedi party, a feminist hacking space, an AcroYoga space, or even a board games room. It can also be a discussion about any of the technical subjects, from computer security to your favorite Python project to professional occupation such as SRE.

## How do I host an Open Space?
Just go to the open space area at gather town, fill in the subject, time and your name and youâ€™re all set!

For those who want to get the event started immediately, simply find a desk and rename your name with your topic. 

## Ideas for Open Spaces
Here are a few ideas for potential Open Space topics and activities:

Hacker space (maker projects) that use Python (e.g. in Raspberry Pis, IOT, home automation, robots / drones / blimps autopiloted with Python)
Hacking / networking / devops
Data visualization / science
Natural language processing and generation (e.g. chatbots)
Quantified self
Diversity initiatives, for example a feminist hackerspace
A space for organizers of conferences, workshops, diversity initiatives (Django Girls, PyLadies, etc.)
Framework-specific Open Spaces, e.g. Django or Flask
How to contribute to open source, a help / mentoring group for beginners
Git
Support: how to avoid burnout
Recruitment workshops
